What are the basics of artificial intelligence (AI) and explainable AI (XAI)?

In light of the idea that artificial intelligence (AI) systems may function as a black box and are therefore not transparent, explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a subfield focused on developing systems humans can understand and explain. 

To understand XAI’s basics and goal, one must grasp what AI is. While artificial intelligence as a field of science has a long history and embraces an expanding set of technological applications, a globally accepted definition for AI is absent. Europe is at the forefront of developing various legal frameworks and ethical guidelines for deploying and developing AI. A ground-breaking proposal from the European Commission (EC) in 2021 set out the regulation for AI’s first legally binding definition.  

Per this proposal, AI can be defined as a system that generates outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments they interact with. Such AI systems are developed in line with one or more techniques and approaches, as discussed below. 

First, they work with machine learning (ML) models (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement and deep learning), all of which are ML categories. It is important to note that ML is an imperative of AI, but not all AI systems work with advanced ML techniques, such as deep learning. ML systems can learn and adapt without following explicit instructions. Indeed, not all ML work toward a preset external goal, with some systems being engineered to “reason” toward abstract objectives and thus function without constant human input.

Moreover, AI systems may work with or combine logic and knowledge-based approaches such as knowledge representation or inductive (logic) programming. The former refers to encoding information in a way that an AI system can use (for instance, by defining rules and relationships between concepts). The latter refers to ML models that learn rules or hypotheses from a set of examples. 

An AI system may deploy other methods, such as statistical approaches (techniques deployed to learn patterns or relationships in data) and search and optimization methods, which seek the best solution to a particular problem by searching a large space of possibilities. 

In addition, AI has also been described as “the ability of a non-natural entity to make choices by an evaluative process,” as defined by Jacob Turner, a lawyer, AI lecturer and author. Taking both the definitions of Turner and of the EC, one can deduce that AI systems can often “learn” and, in this matter, influence their environment. Beyond software, AI may also be captured in different forms or be embodied, such as in robotics. 

So what are the other basics of AI? Since AI systems are data-driven, software code and data are two crucial components of AI. In this context, it can be argued that progress in AI is taking place in an era alongside phenomena including “software eating the world” (meaning that societies and the economy as a whole have seen an immense and ongoing digital transformation) and the “‘datafication’ of the world,” which argues  that said digital transformation went along an ever-increasing amount of data being generated and collected.

But why should one care? Crucially, the capturing and processing of data correlate with how an AI’s set of algorithms is designed. That said, algorithms are guidelines that decide how to perform a task through a sequence of rules.

Why is all of this important? AI makes “choices” or generates output based on the data (input) and the algorithms. Moreover, AI may move its decisions away from human input due to its learning nature and the abovementioned techniques and approaches. Those two features contribute to the idea that AI often functions as a black box. 

The term “black box” refers to the challenge of comprehending and controlling the decisions and actions of AI systems and algorithms, potentially making control and governance over these systems difficult. Indeed, it brings about various transparency and accountability issues with different corresponding legal and regulatory implications. 

This is where explainable AI (XAI) comes into play. XAI aims to provide human-understandable explanations of how an AI system arrives at a particular output. It is specifically aimed at providing transparency in the decision-making process of AI systems.

2.
Why is explainable AI (XAI) important?

XAI involves designing AI systems that can explain their decision-making process through various techniques. XAI should enable external observers to understand better how the output of an AI system comes about and how reliable it is. This is important because AI may bring about direct and indirect adverse effects that can impact individuals and societies. 

Just as explaining what comprehends AI, explaining its results and functioning can also be daunting, especially where deep-learning AI systems come into play. For non-engineers to envision how AI learns and discovers new information, one can hold that these systems utilize complex circuits in their inner core that are shaped similarly to neural networks in the human brain. 

The neural networks that facilitate AI’s decision-making are often called “deep learning” systems. It is debated to what extent decisions reached by deep learning systems are opaque or inscrutable, and to which extent AI and its “thinking” can and should be explainable to ordinary humans.

There is debate among scholars regarding whether deep learning systems are truly black boxes or completely transparent. However, the general consensus is that most decisions should be explainable to some degree. This is significant because the deployment of AI systems by state or commercial entities can negatively affect individuals, making it crucial to ensure that these systems are accountable and transparent.

For instance, the Dutch Systeem Risico Indicatie (SyRI) case is a prominent example illustrating the need for explainable AI in government decision-making. SyRI was an automated decision-making system using AI developed by Dutch semi-governmental organizations that used personal data and other tools to identify potential fraud via untransparent processes later classified as black boxes.

The system came under scrutiny for its lack of transparency and accountability, with national courts and international entities expressing that it violated privacy and various human rights. The SyRi case illustrates how governmental AI applications can affect humans by replicating and amplifying biases and discrimination. SyRi unfairly targeted vulnerable individuals and communities, such as low-income and minority populations. 

SyRi aimed to find potential social welfare fraudsters by labeling certain people as high-risk. SyRi, as a fraud detection system, has only been deployed to analyze people in low-income neighborhoods since such areas were considered “problem” zones. As the state only deployed SyRI’s risk analysis in communities that were already deemed high-risk, it is no wonder that one found more high-risk citizens there (respective to other neighborhoods that are not considered “high-risk”). 

This label, in turn, would encourage stereotyping and reinforce a negative image of the residents who lived in those neighborhoods (even if they were not mentioned in a risk report or qualified as a “no-hit”) due to comprehensive cross-organizational databases in which such data entered and got recycled across public institutions. The case illustrates that where AI systems produce unwanted adverse outcomes such as biases, they may remain unnoted if transparency and external control are lacking.

Besides states, private companies develop or deploy many AI systems with transparency and explainability outweighed by other interests. Although it can be argued that the present-day structures enabling AI wouldn’t exist in their current forms if it were not for past government funding, a significant proportion of the progress made in AI today is privately funded and is steadily increasing. In fact, private investment in AI in 2022 was 18 times higher than in 2013.

Commercial AI “producers” are primarily responsible to their shareholders, thus, may be heavily focused on generating economic profits, protecting patent rights and preventing regulation. Hence, if commercial AI systems’ functioning is not transparent enough, and enormous amounts of data are privately hoarded to train and improve AI, it is essential to understand how such a system works. 

Ultimately, the importance of XAI lies in its ability to provide insights into the decision-making process of its models, enabling users, producers, and monitoring agencies to understand how and why a particular outcome was created. 

This arguably helps to build trust in governmental and private AI systems. It increases accountability and ensures that AI models are not biased or discriminatory. It also helps to prevent the recycling of low-quality or illegal data in public institutions from adverse or comprehensive cross-organizational databases intersecting with algorithmic fraud-detection systems.

3.
How does explainable AI work?

The principles of XAI surround the idea of designing AI systems that are transparent, interpretable and can provide clear justifications for their decisions. In practice, this involves developing AI models that humans understand, which can be audited and reviewed, and are free from unintended consequences, such as biases and discriminatory practices.

Explainability is in making transparent the most critical factors and parameters shaping AI decisions. While it can be argued that it is impossible to provide full explainability at all times due to the internal complexity of AI systems, specific parameters and values can be programmed into AI systems. High levels of explainability are achievable, technically valuable and may drive innovation. 

The importance of transparency and explainability in AI systems has been recognized worldwide, with efforts to develop XAI underway for several years. As noted, XAI has several benefits: Arguably, it is possible to discover how and why it made a decision or acted (in the case of embodied AI) the way it did. Consequently, transparency is essential because it builds trust and understanding for users while allowing for scrutiny simultaneously. 

Explainability is a prerequisite for ascertaining other “ethical” AI principles, such as sustainability, justness and fairness. Theoretically, it allows for the monitoring of AI applications and AI development. This is particularly important for some use cases of AI and XAI, including applications in the justice system, (social) media, healthcare, finance, and national security, where AI models are used to make critical decisions that impact people’s lives and societies at large. 

Several ML techniques can serve as examples of XAI. Such techniques increase explainability, like decision trees (which can provide a clear, visual representation of the decision-making process of an AI model), rule-based systems (algorithmic rules are defined in a human-understandable format in cases in which rules and interpretation are less flexible), Bayesian networks (probabilistic models representing causalities and uncertainties), linear models (models showing how each input contributes to the output), and similar techniques to the latter in the case of neural networks. 

Various approaches to achieving XAI include visualizations, natural language explanations and interactive interfaces. To start with the latter, interactive interfaces allow users to explore how the model’s predictions change as input parameters are adjusted. 

Visualizations like heat maps and decision trees can help individuals visualize the model’s decision-making process. Heat maps showcase color gradients and visually indicate the importance of certain input features, which is the information the (explainable) ML model uses to generate its output or decision. 

Decision trees show an ML’s decision-making process according to different branches that intersect, much like the name suggests. Finally, natural language explanations can provide textual justifications for the AI model’s predictions, making it easier for non-technical users to understand. 

Essential to note that where one is focused on the subfield of machine learning, explainable machine learning (XML) specifically concentrates on making ML models more transparent and interpretable, going beyond the broader field of XAI, which encompasses all types of AI systems. 

4.
What are the limitations of explainable AI?

XAI has several limitations, some of them relating to its implementation. For instance, engineers tend to focus on functional requirements, and even if not, large teams of engineers often develop algorithms over time. This complexity makes a holistic understanding of the development process and values embedded within AI systems less attainable. 

Moreover, “explainable” is an open term, bringing about other crucial notions when considering XAI’s implementation. Embedding in or deducting explainability from AI’s code and algorithms may be theoretically preferable but practically problematic because there is a clash between the prescribed nature of algorithms and code on the one hand and the flexibility of open-ended terminology on the other.

Indeed, when AI’s interpretability is tested by looking at the most critical parameters and factors shaping a decision, questions such as what amounts to “transparent” or “interpretable” AI arise. How high are such thresholds?

Finally, it is widely recognized that AI development happens exponentially. Combining this exponential growth with unsupervised and deep learning systems, AI could, in theory, find ways to become generally intelligent, opening doors to new ideas, innovation and growth. 

To illustrate this, one can consider published research on “generative agents” where large language models were combined with computational, interactive agents. This research introduced generative agents in an interactive sandbox environment consisting of a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. Crucially, the agents produced believable individual and interdependent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party to one another.

Why is the word “autonomously” important? One might argue that when AI systems exhibit behavior that cannot be adequately traced back to its individual components, one must consider that black swan risks or other adverse effects may emerge that cannot be accurately predicted or explained. 

The concept of XAI is of somewhat limited use in these cases, where AI quickly evolves and improves itself. Hence, XAI appears insufficient to mitigate potential risks, and additional preventive measures in the form of guidelines and laws might be required. 

As AI continues to evolve, the importance of XAI will only continue to grow. AI systems may be applied for the good, the bad and the ugly. To which extent AI can shape humans’ future relies partly on who deploys it and for which purposes, how it is combined with other technologies, and to which principles and rules it is aligned. 

XAI could prevent or mitigate some of an AI system’s potential adverse effects. Regardless of the possibility of explaining every decision of an AI system, the existence of the notion of XAI implies that, ultimately, humans are responsible for decisions and actions stemming from AI. And that makes AI and XAI subject to all sorts of interests.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-explainable-ai-xai"

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

According to a Goldman Sachs report published on May 8 titled “Eyes on the Horizon: Family Office Investment Insights,” 32% of family offices currently hold investments in digital assets. This category includes cryptocurrencies, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-focused funds.

The proportion of investments in cryptocurrencies among investors interested in digital finance has risen significantly since 2021, from 16% to 26%. However, the interest in potential investments in crypto has crashed this year, with just 12% of investors indicating it, down from 45% in 2021. As highlighted in the report:

“Opinions on cryptocurrencies seem to have crystallized: a greater proportion of family offices are now invested in cryptocurrencies, but the proportion that are not invested and not interested in investing in the future has grown more.”

The report is based on a survey conducted between January and February 2023 via questionnaires distributed to home offices by email. Overall, 166 home offices participated, 95 of which are based in the Americas, 34 in Europe and the Middle East, and 37 in the Asia Pacific.

Goldman Sachs appeared among the top winners during the recent banking crisis, with many investors deciding to rotate their portfolio investments. Goldman Sachs’ money funds have received $52 billion — a 13% growth — in the biggest monthly volume of inflows since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Coinbase’s legal chief has requested the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) make several revisions to its proposed regulation on the responsibilities of registered investment advisers (RIAs) for storing client assets with qualified custodians.

Although the SEC acknowledges Coinbase Custody Trust Company as a “qualified custodian,“ Coinbase contends that the updated RIA custody rule unfairly targets crypto and makes improper assumptions about custodial practices based on securities. According to a May 8 letter from Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal, the proposed SEC rulemaking fails to safeguard other asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase Custody Trust Company is recognized as a qualified custodian for RIA clients. This custodian is responsible for protecting client assets from potential threats such as bankruptcy and cyberattacks.

This letter advocates for expanding the custody obligations proposal to ensure that it remains adaptable to future investments and protects them appropriately.

An RIA is a company that advises clients on investments in securities and may handle their investment portfolios. These firms are registered with the SEC or state securities administrators, depending on the value of the assets under management.

In the letter addressed to the SEC, Grewal criticized the proposed rulemaking titled “Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets, Proposed Rule 223-1” as misguided. Grewal called for a revision to the proposal and staff guidance, highlighting the need to safeguard all asset classes, including crypto assets, which haven’t been classified as securities until now.

Grewal suggests several revisions to the rule to protect investors, including defining state trust companies and other state-regulated financial institutions as qualified custodians, a longstanding congressional and SEC policy. He also proposes allowing limited exposure to non-qualified custodians and removing the ban on RIA client trades on crypto exchanges, which are not qualified custodians.

The SEC is expected to comply with the court order and respond to Coinbase’s writ of mandamus this week. Coinbase filed a lawsuit in April 2022, requesting that the court compel the SEC to publicly disclose its stance on a petition submitted several months prior. In the petition, the exchange posed 50 specific questions about the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets.

To send and receive payments on the Lightning Network, users must first set up a Lightning wallet and fund it with Bitcoin. From there, they can create payment channels and start transacting. This article will guide users through the process, from setting up their Lightning wallet to making their first Lightning payment.

What is the Lightning Network

The Lightning Network (LN for short, or simply “Lightning”) is a decentralized system for instant, high-volume micropayments that prevents users from delegating custody of funds to trusted third parties. It is a layer-2 protocol — a computer network built on top of the Bitcoin base layer (layer 1), the actual blockchain. The Lightning Network uses the Bitcoin base layer’s high protection standards to secure the network.

Bitcoin is a payment system designed to be slow, and its transactions are finalized in as long as one hour; this is because Bitcoin assembles transactions into blocks spaced on average 10 minutes apart, and payments are considered secure after confirmation of six blocks, which is about one hour. This is not ideal for micropayments and smaller transfers that are typically inefficient due to high base-layer fees.

Imagine people waiting one hour to pay for a coffee or a train ticket when they scan their phone through the station gate. The high fees add up to make the whole payment process clunky, inefficient and too costly for everyday Bitcoin network transactions.

The Lightning Network solves these problems as one of the first implementations of a multi-party smart contract using Bitcoin’s built-in scripting. On the Lightning Network, payments are instant, atomic and are not recorded on the blockchain; therefore, they don't require block confirmations to finalize. Lightning can be used by retailers for their point-of-sale terminals, by individuals for device-to-device transactions such as remittance payments, or whenever instant payments are needed without the validation of third parties.

The Lightning Network allows users to quickly send and receive Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,598

 with virtually no or minimal fees while achieving a throughput (message delivery rate) of approximately 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Compared to Solana, with 65,000 TPS, or even Visa, which has the infrastructure to process around 24,000 TPS, the Lightning Network is by far the fastest payment method available.

To meet the increasing demand for Bitcoin payments and micropayments, the network will need to support a much higher volume of transactions, which would be impossible to scale on the layer-1 chain. This is why the Lightning Network is considered by many the solution to scale Bitcoin in a way that doesn’t affect its decentralization and without delegation of trust and ownership.

How to pay on the Lightning Network

Users need to get a Lightning Network-enabled Bitcoin wallet — where funds are placed into a two-party, multisignature “channel” Bitcoin address — to make Bitcoin Lightning Network payments. Understandably, the person or the business to be paid will also have a Bitcoin wallet with access to Lightning.

Most wallets are mobile due to a phone’s ease and frequency of performing instant payments. Examples of Bitcoin Lightning wallet apps include Muun, Wallet of Satoshi, Phoenix and Cash App, and they can be downloaded on both iOS and Android devices. Muun facilitates submarine swaps, a fast trade between on-chain and off-chain digital assets.

Submarine swap is a type of off-chain cryptocurrency transaction that allows for the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another. It uses the Lightning Network to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions. Phoenix (a non-custodial wallet) and Wallet of Satoshi provide nearly instantaneous safe payments with minimal fees.

Most wallets are non-custodial, meaning that the Bitcoin funds are under the custody of the owners only, and they have a multi-signature feature as an extra layer of protection for the private key.

By depositing BTC into a Lightning wallet, users open a channel, and that is their entry into the network. Even if it’s impossible to see, every time a user pays a new person or a new business with the Lightning Network, the user opens a channel with that counterparty.

This channel can be direct and created on purpose between two parties to transact easily. Alternatively, it can be a routing payment over Lightning, allowing Lightning transactions between two unconnected parties to use a series of pre-existing channels.

Once users establish a channel, they will access the entire network’s public channels, all stitched together and ready to route payments, with lightning nodes searching for the best route to perform the transaction. This is why when users pay a new retailer, they can do it instantly just by scanning the QR code, without having to open a direct channel.

Payments occur through a channel instantly, with near-zero fees, without going through Bitcoin’s base layer all the time.

Making a payment through the Lightning Network is as simple as any other digital payment method and can be done by following these steps:

Open the payer’s wallet on the Lightning page.
Click on “Send.”
Scan the merchant’s or an individual’s QR code button or enter the address manually.
Confirm everything is correct and proceed with the checkout.

Similarly, to receive Bitcoin with Lightning, the following steps may help:

Open your wallet on the Lightning page.
Click on “Receive.”
Scan your QR code button on the payer’s device or have the person enter the address manually.
Confirm everything is correct and proceed with the checkout.

The Lightning Network wallets may be suitable for keeping a small amount of Bitcoin for everyday expenses. However, it is important to note that manually entering a payment address on the Lightning Network can be error-prone and time-consuming. In contrast, scanning a QR code provides a more accurate and faster way of entering the payment address and, therefore, completing the transaction.

How to fund your Lightning Network wallet with BTC

In order to open a channel or process a payment, a user will need some BTC funds in the wallet. To upload Bitcoin to a wallet, here are the usual steps to follow:

You should set up your wallet to use the Bitcoin base chain (Bitcoin wallet) or the Lightning Network (Lightning wallet). Select the wallet network you want to use.
Go to “Receive” and click on it.
Check the transaction details are correct.
Scan the QR code or copy and paste the receiving address onto the wallet you’re getting your funds from.
You have the option to add an invoice for the payment. Click on the “Invoice” button to proceed.

Once you’ve received BTC and opened a channel, you can send and receive Bitcoin with no time or amount limits. The Lightning Network is still considered experimental and must be refined, and it is therefore recommended not to store a significant amount of BTC in a Lightning wallet.

Who runs the Lightning Network

The Lightning Network is an open-source project that was ideated by research scientists Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja in 2015. Starting as a way to address the significant increase in Bitcoin’s transaction fees, the project developed a new payment system built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. In January 2016, the duo published the white paper, and the project started gaining more traction among developers and investors.

The same year, Lightning Labs — the company developing and maintaining the Lightning Network — was co-founded by Elizabeth Stark. The organization released a beta version of the ecosystem for developers to test, highlighting the value that layer-2 solutions can bring to the greater ecosystem.

With increasing amounts of funding and interest around the Lightning Network, such an ecosystem is gaining growing traction among Bitcoin enthusiasts, especially in light of the Lightning Network smart contract set up, which may open opportunities in decentralized finance and other applications.

How to receive Bitcoin on the Cash App

To deposit Bitcoin into Cash App, Bitcoin withdrawals and deposits must be enabled within the app by taking the following steps:

Click on the “Money” tab on your Cash App home screen.
Select “Bitcoin.”
Click on “Deposit Bitcoin” to get started.
Copy your Bitcoin wallet address onto the sender’s relevant box.

A wallet’s unique address can be used to receive Bitcoin from a third party to your account and will change after each successful deposit to ensure more privacy. Users can deposit up to $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in any seven-day period. As transferring Bitcoin occurs in the base-layer chain, it may take hours for transfers to be confirmed.

How to use the Cash App Lightning Network

In October 2022, Cash App added the Lightning Network to the Bitcoin wallet to enable Bitcoin’s faster transactions with little to no fees. Here’s how to send BTC using the Cash App Lightning Network:

Click on the payments “$” tab on Cash App to view the home screen.
Select the QR scanner on the top left corner of the screen.
Hold your camera over the Lightning invoice QR code to scan it.
Follow the instructions to confirm and pay the request.

Similarly, the following steps illustrate how to receive Bitcoin using the Cash App Lightning Network:

Open Cash App and click on the Money tab.
Select “Bitcoin.”
Click on “Receive” Bitcoin.
Share the QR code or link with the sender and scan.

To receive Bitcoin with the Lightning Network, the sender doesn’t need a Cash App account to pay a user’s request, but the sender will need a Lightning-enabled Bitcoin wallet.

Moving funds with Lightning addresses (LNURLs)

The Lightning Network is gradually being adopted across the crypto community and service providers, including exchanges. Kraken was one of the first to implement Lightning in March 2022. Moreover, in April 2023, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced a Coinbase-Lightning Network partnership, meaning one of the most popular exchanges in the world will be adopting Bitcoin’s instant payment network soon.

In December 2022, Lightning addresses were added to the Lightning Network. A Lightning address is like an email address but for Bitcoin, a straightforward way for anyone to send Bitcoin instantly on the Lightning Network, ushering in a new standard for how value moves around the world.

LNURLs gained a lot of traction recently when Armstrong apparently failed to recognize the Lightning address of Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall, missing a payment due to the writer and stirring some debate on Twitter. Lightning addresses are a crucial addition to Lightning payment services, even though they will take time to be fully adopted.

Coinbase legal chief sends letter to SEC on RIA rulemaking

Coinbase’s chief legal officer requests revisions to the SEC’s RIA custody rule to safeguard all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, criticizing the rule for unfairly targeting crypto.

Coinbase’s legal chief has requested the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) make several revisions to its proposed regulation on the responsibilities of registered investment advisers (RIAs) for storing client assets with qualified custodians.

Although the SEC acknowledges Coinbase Custody Trust Company as a “qualified custodian,“ Coinbase contends that the updated RIA custody rule unfairly targets crypto and makes improper assumptions about custodial practices based on securities. According to a May 8 letter from Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal, the proposed SEC rulemaking fails to safeguard other asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase Custody Trust Company is recognized as a qualified custodian for RIA clients. This custodian is responsible for protecting client assets from potential threats such as bankruptcy and cyberattacks.

This letter advocates for expanding the custody obligations proposal to ensure that it remains adaptable to future investments and protects them appropriately.

An RIA is a company that advises clients on investments in securities and may handle their investment portfolios. These firms are registered with the SEC or state securities administrators, depending on the value of the assets under management.

In the letter addressed to the SEC, Grewal criticized the proposed rulemaking titled “Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets, Proposed Rule 223-1” as misguided. Grewal called for a revision to the proposal and staff guidance, highlighting the need to safeguard all asset classes, including crypto assets, which haven’t been classified as securities until now.

Grewal suggests several revisions to the rule to protect investors, including defining state trust companies and other state-regulated financial institutions as qualified custodians, a longstanding congressional and SEC policy. He also proposes allowing limited exposure to non-qualified custodians and removing the ban on RIA client trades on crypto exchanges, which are not qualified custodians.

The SEC is expected to comply with the court order and respond to Coinbase’s writ of mandamus this week. Coinbase filed a lawsuit in April 2022, requesting that the court compel the SEC to publicly disclose its stance on a petition submitted several months prior. In the petition, the exchange posed 50 specific questions about the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets.

While the Ordinals protocol was initially used to mint images as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), users began to realize that they could use text-based inscriptions to create fungible tokens in a similar way to those minted via the ERC-20 token standard on the Ethereum (ETH) network.

These text-based inscriptions, now popularized as the BRC-20 token standard, have been the main cause of the massive uptick in Ordinals inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain.

As highlighted by Glassnode co-founder and chief technology officer Rafael Schultze-Kraft on Twitter, text-based inscriptions are now the most popular form of Ordinals inscription, with more than 2.8 million text-based inscriptions as of May 5.

More recent data from popular blockchain data hub Dune Analytics shows that since April 25, the overwhelming majority (99%) of all new Ordinals inscriptions have been text-based.

According to brc-20.io, a new tool that allows users to track BRC-20 tokens, there are currently a total of 14,200 new tokens hosted on the Bitcoin blockchain. Counted among the most popular Bitcoin-based tokens are “ordi”, “nals” and even a Bitcoin-based version of the now-notorious memecoin Pepe (PEPE) being listed at number 3 by total market cap.

The rise of Ordinals over the last few months has continued to spark debate around whether Ordinals are ultimately a positive for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Some Bitcoin proponents, such as Dan Held, claim that Ordinals offers a wider spread of financial use cases for Bitcoin, while more hardline Bitcoiners argue that Ordinals stray from the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, who intended for Bitcoin to be used as an electronic, peer-to-peer cash system.

Meanwhile, miners have enjoyed an enormous influx of revenue due to the transaction fees related to the burst of new activity on the network.

‘Unjustly enriched’ — Core Scientific knocks back $4.7M claim from Celsius

Core Scientific has rejected a multi-million-dollar administrative claim from Celsius Network, arguing it’s owed an even higher amount from the crypto lender.

$27,598

 mining firm Core Scientific has objected to paying a $4.7 million administrative claim put forward by crypto lender Celsius Network, leading to a battle between the firms over contractual obligations.

According to the objection filed in Texas bankruptcy court on May 5, Core Scientific has asked that Celsius Network’s $4.7 million administrative claims be rejected as the firm cannot prove it is entitled to one.

“Celsius’ request for allowance and immediate payment of the Celsius alleged admin claim ignores that Core has substantial claims against Celsius, which Core believes exceed the Celsius alleged admin claim,” wrote the objection.

For context, Core first signed a contract with Celsius in 2020 to host its cryptocurrency holdings in Core’s data centers. However, due to an increase in the price of power, Core passed these additional costs on to Celsius, an allowance that was reportedly stipulated in the original contract.

Despite Celsius initially paying these costs, the crypto lender ceased payments after it filed bankruptcy, Core Scientific claimed in the objection.

“If anyone has been unjustly enriched here, it is Celsius,” Core Scientific wrote in the objection. According to the now-defunct Bitcoin miner, Celsius has been “sitting on almost $8 million of money it owes to Core” due to a “blatant post-petition violation” of the agreed-upon dispute resolution mechanism.

Related: Bittrex files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy just weeks after SEC charges

Celsius now owes Core Scientific a total of approximately $11 million, a sum that accrues an additional $28,000 in fees and interest with each passing day, the Bitcoin mining firm’s lawyers argued.

The conflict between the two firms has been raging since Oct. 19, when Core Scientific first accused Celsius of failing to pay its power bills, citing the non-payments as a significant factor in the liquidity issues that led to the embattled Bitcoin miner filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Dec. 21.

“The millions of dollars Celsius shortchanged Core after Celsius’s bankruptcy filing plus the millions of dollars in litigation…significantly contributed to Core’s liquidity drain and eventual chapter 11 filing.”

On Dec. 28, Core Scientific filed a motion seeking approval to reject Celsius’ contracts, claiming the firm’s failure to pay its power bills constituted a material breach of contract. On Jan. 3, Celsius agreed to let Core Scientific shut down more than 37,000 Bitcoin mining rigs that the miner was hosting for the crypto lender.

Canadians are being asked to submit what features they want to be included in a potential digital Canadian dollar, with the country’s central bank opening a consultation to the public.

On May 8, the Bank of Canada (BoC) launched a public consultation that will run until June 19, noting it’s exploring a virtual loonie as “the world becomes increasingly digital.”

The BoC’s senior deputy governor Carolyn Rogers said in a statement the bank wants to hear what Canadians “value most in the design of a digital dollar” to help it make choices relating to its security and reliability along with ensuring it “meets the needs of Canadians.”

The bank was quick to state that it's not starting work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and wasn’t looking to replace cash if it does.

“At this time, a digital Canadian dollar is not needed. And any decision to issue one rests with Parliament and the Government of Canada.”

“Cash isn’t going anywhere,” the BoC added. It said, however, that many Canadians could be excluded from the economy in the future if the use of banknotes falls.

If a CBDC was issued, physical notes would still be provided “for those who want them” the bank said.

The BoC also outlined the possibility that cryptocurrencies or foreign CBDCs “could become widely used in Canada.”

It claimed this scenario could compromise the Canadian dollar and “pose a risk to the stability of our financial system.”

The consultation’s questionnaire asks Canadians a wide range of questions including the payment methods they’ve used in the last month, how often they would potentially use a Canadian CBDC and what design features they wish to see.

It also specifically asks if the survey taker uses or holds cryptocurrencies and features a range of demographic questions about gender, age, education and income.

The BoC said it will publish a report summarizing the consultation “later this year.”

Worth it? Trader spends $120K on gas buying $155K worth of a memecoin

A user spent an additional 76% of their total purchase price in gas fees on a single memecoin trade.

A single trader just spent a staggering 64 Ether — equivalent to $118,000 — in gas fees purchasing $155,000 worth of a memecoin called Four (FOUR).

According to an update from the popular blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, the lone trader paid an astonishing $119,157 in Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 to complete a Uniswap trade that swapped 84 Wrapped Ether (WETH) for 13.8 billion FOUR tokens.

A fee of 64 #ETH (119,121 USD) has just been paid for a single transaction!https://t.co/3w4UD0AZbw

— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 8, 2023

It appears as though the trader voluntarily increased their gas fee to speed up the transaction time to purchase the memecoin. According to pseudonymous Twitter user FlurETH, the trader in question is sitting on 133 ETH ($245,667) in unrealized profit on their investment in the memecoin.

Gas fees on the Ethereum network have become the subject of debate amongst the crypto community, with a number of prominent Etheruem advocates praising the heightened activity for its revenue generating effects and long-term deflationary pressure on the supply of Ether.

— sassal.eth (@sassal0x) April 20, 2023

Others have leveled criticism at the fees, claiming that unless the network becomes more “affordable” mass adoption will never be achieved.

As reported by Cointelegraph, one of the main drivers behind the increase in Ethereum gas fees comes from the recent memecoin mania, driven in large part by the frenzied buying of a new memecoin called Pepe (PEPE). At the time of publication, the average Ethereum transaction fee is sitting at $22.98, the highest level recorded since May 12, 2022, when the average fee reached a peak of $31.11.

Another major reason behind the drastic uptick in gas fees comes from the maximal extractable value trading bot that is front-running memecoin trades en masse. The notorious MEV bot and “sandwich” attacker, known only by the pseudonym jaredfromsubway.eth, has been profiting significantly from the heightened network use.

A sandwich attack occurs when an attacker “sandwiches” a victim’s transaction between their own two transactions in order to manipulate the price and profit from the user.

On April 18, Jared cleared a whopping $950,000 in profits from the sandwich attacks. Jared has also been one of the largest gas spenders on the Ethereum network. On April 20, Jared used 7% of the total gas on the network and spent 455 ETH in transaction fees.

The rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) spearheaded a new era of digital ownership and investment. With a record number of new NFT collections launched in 2022, the NFT market capped $50 billion in sales volume for the first time. As a fast-growing market operating entirely in the digital world, however, it didn’t take long for the NFT industry to become a haven for fraudsters.

A recent report unveiled that in 2022, more than half of the NFT activity on the Ethereum blockchain, the most popular network for NFT trades, was fraudulent. From wash trading to copycat collections, the NFT market entered 2023 with a set of critical issues that could only be solved by advanced market intelligence and analytics. Assessing a fair price for an NFT is already tricky, as tremendous gaps between the floor price and the price ceiling are not uncommon for collections. On top of that, malicious market activity only adds more confusion to users’ NFT investment or trade decisions.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Top-10 NFT collections of 2022 by sale volume, excluding wash trade volume. Source: bitsCrunch

While NFTs from popular collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) hold immense value in the market, it’s relatively easy to copy the visual appearance of apes depicted in the collection as image files and then create fake NFTs based on copycat material. The $1.53 billion sales volume of the BAYC collection in 2022 presents a lucrative market for fake NFTs as well.

The impact of counterfeit NFTs

Fake NFTs created by copying the image of original art can be difficult to detect in the digital environment, resulting in significant financial losses for buyers. The impact of fake tokens in the NFT market includes economic, legal and reputational consequences. Investors who lose confidence in the ecosystem due to fake NFTs are less likely to return to the market. Without significant demand, the prices of NFTs are bound to drop.

Without proper tools, NFT collectors can quickly get confused trying to find an authentic NFT on the marketplace and trace its history. Luckily, recent tech developments in artificial intelligence (AI) now allow for the prevention of NFT buyers from investing in fake content. NFT analytics provider bitsCrunch recently launched an AI-powered tool that checks major blockchains and marketplaces for potential copycat or forged NFTs.

Fake NFTs caught by AI

By analyzing over 800,000 assets on the top NFT marketplace OpenSea against the top-40 NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, bitsCrunch found out that 144 copycat NFTs are exact visual matches to the BAYC collection. Moreover, 231 NFTs were flagged as near-exact matches, while “extremely similar” copies are as high as 814.

Over 140 fake NFTs are indistinguishable from the original BAYC collection. Source: bitsCrunch

The fake NFT issue is hardly exclusive to BAYC. Other trending collections, including Azuki, Otherdeed and CloneX, have tens of exact copies detected by AI-powered analytics. bitsCrunch detects forged material across blockchain networks and flags newly-minted and existing counterfeit NFTs by analyzing real-time data.

AI-powered price estimation for NFTs

Confusion across the NFT market also arises when users want to put a fair price tag on an NFT they aim to sell, as floor price — the lowest-priced item listed for a specific collection — rarely gives a reliable perspective.

Many factors, including trading volume and history, last traded price and the profile of previous buyers, come into account when deciding the final price of a digital collectible. However, AI can now aid buyers and sellers in the form of the NFT Price Estimation tool by bitsCrunch. Aiming to accurately determine the true value of NFTs, the Price Estimation tool uses analyzed historical info and metadata for an NFT combined with the social media hype around the collection to provide more accurate price estimates.

The AI-driven machine learning tool has studied over 30 million NFTs from more than 2,200 collections to apply advanced data and analytics, benefiting the user when making buying or selling decisions.

The full potential of the NFT space can only be unlocked via tools that fight against issues like wash trading and forgery plaguing the market for the last couple of years. Users need AI-powered advanced analytics and intelligence presented on easy-to-understand screens to benefit from market data.

bitsCrunch offers accurate NFT analytics and forensics with UnleashNFTs to supply users with reliable insights into the market. The platform provides in-depth analysis, research and statistics about the NFT ecosystem, helping buyers and sellers to make better decisions with each NFT trade.

Additionally, as part of its commitment to bring more awareness and data transparency to the NFT ecosystem, bitsCrunch has launched its startup program. Companies working with NFTs can join this initiative to get quick access to bitsCrunch tools for analyzing and managing risk via API. Equipped with AI-powered analytics, NFT creators, traders and businesses can detect and avoid malicious activities while making transactions, thus expanding the NFT ecosystem in a healthier direction.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) space has been in correction mode, its current TVL of $50 billion representing less than a third of its peak in late 2021. The good news is that the market is preparing for another wave of DeFi adoption, primarily thanks to liquid staking tokens (LSTs), which have become the second-largest DeFi sector after decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

With the Shanghai upgrade already live since mid-April, we can see a gold rush of LST adoption, with the DeFi community embracing LSTs for their ability to be the “internet bond” and provide a native form of yield. This can lead to DeFi protocols racing to get ahead by integrating LSTs. The sooner that DeFi protocols integrate LSTs, the greater the chance to secure a better place in the upcoming DeFi race, as the Shanghai update is expected to boost demand for staking services that also provide yield opportunities.

This liquid staking protocol addresses main obstacles in LST space

Even before the impact of the Shapella upgrade becomes evident, liquid staking protocols are popular due to their unique functionality. Nevertheless, many of them deal with a range of pain points that impact user satisfaction. One of the challenges is the complexity of token models, which can create confusion for users who may struggle to understand the mechanics and implications of their investments. This complexity can stem from the varying tokenomics, reward structures, and risk profiles of different protocols, making it difficult for users to navigate the ecosystem and make informed decisions.

Another major issue is poor user experience, which can be attributed to the lack of user-friendly interfaces, inadequate documentation, and insufficient support services.

High fees are also a concern in some liquid staking protocols, as they can significantly eat into staking yields and reduce the overall attractiveness of liquid staking.

One of the few liquid staking protocols that is working to address these challenges is Swell, which lets users stake ETH and receive swETH to start earning rewards in DeFi. While there are many liquid staking options, Swell aims to fix all the issues and compile the best offerings into a user-friendly experience. Swell focuses on simplicity, enabling ETH stakers to seamlessly dive into the journey of DeFi through its noncustodial decentralized application (DApp).

Source: Swell

Besides an improved user experience, Swell is reducing fees to unlock more rewards for users. As a rule, the fee rate for staking ranges from 10% to 25%, and may go even higher. With Swell, users can expect no protocol fees for a limited period.

Swell is also putting a great emphasis on security, especially as the DeFi market has been plagued by hacking attacks and scams. The protocol is audited by high-profile blockchain security services including Sigma Prime.

Swell can help DeFi projects, including lending protocols, DEXs and yield farming services, attract more users and secure a continual growth of the sector’s TVL. Meanwhile, individual stakers can start earning rewards without any deposit barriers.

With the DeFi race driven by liquid staking gaining traction, Swell will contribute to the next DeFi transformation by helping DeFi protocols grow their communities while offering stakers the best yield opportunities.

Just hours after the initial decentralized exchange offering (IDO) for Cetus began on May 8, its hard cap target of 800,000 Sui (SUI) tokens has already been surpassed, with over 6 million SUI committed worth approximately $6.85 million at the time of publication. Developers claimed that the IDO reached its initial goal in less than 30 seconds after the sale went live.

Cetus is a DEX and liquidity protocol built on Sui and Aptos. The IDO, which is scheduled to take place from May 8 to 10, is still ongoing despite the initial target being reached. During the IDO, 20 million Cetus tokens (CETUS) are up for grabs out of a total supply of 1 billion CETUS. Users can commit SUI in exchange for CETUS at an exchange rate of 1 SUI to 25 CETUS. The rules and token metrics of the public sale, along with the price of SUI, would place the Cetus DEX at an initial valuation of $45.8 million. 

The IDO has a hard cap of 800,000 SUI. According to developers, when the total commitment surpasses this amount, “Each purchaser’s final purchase amount accepted by the Seller will be a portion of their committed amount, calculated proportional to all the respective committed amounts from all purchasers in the IDO.”

Although IDOs can surpass their initial goals due to popularity, others can also reach this outcome simply by the way their public sale is designed, i.e. ""surpassed"" on purpose. Like their initial coin offerings counterparts, investments in IDOs are considered to be high risk and can be subjected to rug pulls, scams, or lack of traction thereafter. 

A layer-1 blockchain created by former Meta executives, the Sui mainnet officially launched on May 3, along with listings of its Sui token. The SUI public sale took place weeks prior, with an offering price of 0.1 Tether 

USDT

$1.00

 per SUI.

Immediately after the listing, the price of SUI opened at $4.50 apiece with a fully diluted market capitalization of $45 billion before plunging 75% to trade at $1.14 at the time of publication. Before the listing, Binance introduced Sui LaunchPools, where users could stake either BNB

$313

 or TrueUSD (TUSD) for a limited supply of SUI rewards. The LaunchPools reached nearly $4 billion in total value locked in just two days.

A suspect identified only as “Hong” was detained by local authorities and arrested in the Gansu district of China after allegedly using ChatGPT to generate fake news stories. 

According to a report from the South China Morning Post, Hong was detained after an investigation into an unsubstantiated article relating to a train crash was discovered on April 18 by law enforcement agents.

Hong’s arrest for “using artificial intelligence technology to concoct false and untrue information” came after cybersecurity specialists discovered at least 20 accounts had simultaneously posted the fake news article to a popular blogging site hosted by Chinese tech conglomerate Baidu.

China’s laws regarding the use of social media are considered among the strictest in the world. Police said Hong was arrested for running afoul of an ordinance against “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” a catch-all law that specifically covers spreading fake news and rumors on the internet.

If charged, Hong faces up to five years in prison under the normal statute. However, if courts view the offense as egregious, they could be sentenced to as many as 10 years under the law’s extended provisions covering crimes considered especially severe.

While the ChatGPT service is currently banned in China, its use can be obfuscated by virtual private networks (VPNs).

Similar homegrown artificial intelligence (AI) services, such as Alibaba’s “Tongyi Qianwen,” a recently announced generative AI model trained to answer questions in both English and Mandarin, have received the Chinese government’s blessing. However, as Cointelegraph reported in mid-April, it remains unclear whether Tongyi Qianwen will have the same creative abilities as ChatGPT.

The lack of robust generative AI models in China could potentially have a chilling effect on the nation’s tech scene, especially in sectors such as fintech and cryptocurrency trading, where the use of ChatGPT and products built on OpenAI’s GPT API have exploded into popularity.

Join us on social networks

The risk/reward ratio or risk/return ratio is a commonly used metric in trading that compares the potential profit of a trade with the potential loss. That said, it’s the reward traders stand to make for the risk they take. 

For example, an investment with a risk/reward ratio of 1:3 would mean that for every dollar the investor spends, they gain three dollars if the trading goes in their favor. The risk/reward ratio is decisive to cryptocurrency trading, whether for daily trades or crypto investment for the long run, known as “hodling.”

To gain a better understanding, let's consider it in the context of crypto trading.

How to calculate the risk/reward ratio

Assuming that the prevailing price of Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 is $2,000, a crypto trader might decide to enter a long position (buy) with the following parameters:

Entry price: $2,000

The price at which they purchase ETH.

Stop-loss: $1,800

Should the price of ETH go down, which is not in the trader’s favor, the stop-loss point is where they would sell the ETH acquired (for a loss) and avoid further losses. In other words, they’re risking $200 per ETH bought at $2000.

Take profit: $3,000

If the price of ETH goes up, the take profit price is the point they would sell the ETH, which, in this case, would be for a profit of $1000, a reward of $1000 per ETH.

Plenty of risk/reward ratio calculators are available online for cryptocurrency trading. Using the above example, here’s how to manually calculate the risk/reward ratio:

The initial risk is $200 per ETH (the distance between the entry price of $2,000 and the stop-loss price of $1,800).
The take-profit level offers a reward of $1,000 per ETH, which gives a risk-reward ratio of 1:5 ($200 risk divided by $1,000 reward).

Here is the formula for the risk/reward ratio:

What are the pros, cons, buts and howevers of the risk/reward ratio?

The risk/reward ratio helps traders evaluate a trade’s potential risks and rewards, and make decisions accordingly. It allows traders to manage risk effectively by setting stop-loss orders and take-profit levels, limiting potential losses while maximizing profits.

However, the risk/reward ratio is a measure for managing risk and does not guarantee success in trading because:

It is based on assumptions about an asset’s future price movement, which may not always hold.
It can be oversimplified and may not consider other important factors, such as market conditions, liquidity and transaction costs.

For example, if the market suddenly becomes highly volatile (high price fluctuations), a trader may need to keep adjusting stop-loss or take profit levels. And the crypto market is known to breed volatility.

After calculating the risk/reward ratio, the trader should evaluate whether it suits their trading strategy and risk tolerance. That said, one cannot rely solely on the risk/reward ratio for cryptocurrency trading. Traders should use it with other risk management strategies, trading plans and discipline to succeed.

How to optimize the risk/reward ratio?

What is considered a good risk/reward ratio? While 1:2 is regarded as a practical and optimal risk/reward ratio in crypto (as well as traditional trading), there are no fixed rules for its use, with the ratio depending on the traders’ expectations and strategy.

Arriving at the optimal risk/reward ratio requires balancing a trade’s potential risk and reward, which depends on risk tolerance and trading strategy. Several metrics can accompany the risk/reward ratio or enable traders to optimize it.

Here’s how to use the risk/reward ratio for crypto trading:

Position size

The position size is not necessarily a measure or metric; it’s the amount of capital (crypto asset capital) allocated to each trade. Determining the position size is a critical component of trading risk management strategy. It helps to control potential losses and profits of a trade.

The position size directly impacts the risk/reward ratio, i.e., a larger position size can increase a trade’s potential profit and the possible loss. Conversely, a smaller position size may limit the potential profit and loss.

Win rate

The win rate is the percentage of the total number of profitable trades to the total trades, measuring how often a trader’s trades are profitable. A high win rate means the trader consistently makes profitable trades and doesn’t need to rely as heavily on big winning trades. Accordingly, the trader can afford to use a lower and safer risk/reward ratio, which can still be profitable because the trader is winning more often.

On the other hand, a lower win rate means that the trader needs to rely more on big winning trades to make money and face the volatility risks associated with a more significant risk/reward ratio.

Maximum drawdown (MDD)

Maximum drawdown is an essential metric for traders to consider when assessing their trades’ risk/reward ratio. It is the biggest percentage drop a trader sees in their trading account from its highest value before the decline started. It measures the largest amount of money a trader lost in their account from its highest value before things started going downhill. So how does maximum drawdown influence the risk/reward ratio?

Suppose a trader has a risk/reward ratio of 1:2, meaning they risk $1 to potentially make a profit of $2. Furthermore, imagine the maximum drawdown of the trading strategy is 50%. In that case, the trader could potentially lose half of their trading account before the strategy turns around and becomes profitable again.

As such, even though the risk/reward ratio is favorable, the strategy’s overall risk may be too high. One way around this is to use a narrow stop-loss and avoid the potential loss of the maximum drawdown. However, this translates to a lesser risk/reward ratio.

It’s about finding the right balance between managing the maximum drawdown risk and maintaining a favorable risk/reward ratio.

Expectancy

Expectancy measures the likelihood of making a profit over the long term on a series of trades or investments. It measures the long-term profitability of a trading or investing strategy. Positive expectancy is more or less like the ultimate objective of all trading initiatives.

Akin to the win rate, the loss rate is the unprofitable percentage. The average win and loss sizes are the average profits and losses on a series of trades or investments.

The risk/reward ratio plays a critical role in determining expectancy. A high risk/reward ratio means that potential profits are more considerable than potential losses. This means that if a trader wins 33% of their trades with, say, a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, their average win is twice as large as the average loss, which, in turn, translates to higher expectancy. Conversely, for a low risk/reward ratio, traders would need more wins (win rate).

What factors should be considered while determining the risk/reward ratio in cryptocurrency trading?

Several factors often influence cryptocurrency trading and the risk traders will take to hit the desired profits. Here are a few:

Crypto market volatility

If there is one thing the cryptocurrency ecosystem is infamous for — apart from the hacks and rug pulls — it is how volatile its trading scene is. Set risk/reward ratio with careful consideration.

Liquidity

In simple words, liquidity refers to reserves, tokens or token pools readily available for exchange. It translates to the ability to buy and sell assets quickly and easily. Low liquidity of a crypto asset can increase the risk of trading and make it more challenging to realize profits.

Strength of underlying technology

What the trading token stands for, i.e., the problem it solves and the potential of its growth, greatly influences the risk of trading with it. The more reputed and established the token, the lower the risk of trading with it.

Regulatory landscape

The cryptocurrency world has a long way to go regarding the regulations jurisdictions create around it. And each new (or updated) law directly impacts trading sentiment.

How important is the risk/reward ratio in cryptocurrency trading?

Just as a seesaw balances two opposing forces, the risk and reward of an investment opportunity must also be carefully balanced. The risk/reward ratio requires constant adjustments and vigilance to maintain balance and avoid the pitfalls of either extreme.

As detailed in this article, there are many ways to optimize it and several factors influencing it. While it is an important metric, it is not a holy grail solution that guarantees success in any crypto trading strategy. Understand and experiment with how it plays into the broader set of trading strategies and risk management.

Liechtenstein Prime Minister Daniel Risch announced plans to accept Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,598

 as payment for government services. As reported in local news, the micro-European nation continues to embrace blockchain technologies.

Risch, who also serves as finance minister, is quoted as saying:

“A payment option with Bitcoin is coming.”

However, he did not give a timeframe. Moreover, the principality is unlikely to accept Bitcoin and “hodl” (hold onto) the satoshis it receives. Instead, it will accept deposits in Bitcoin and immediately exchange them for Swiss francs, the national currency. The direct exchange into fiat money sidesteps the currency’s volatility.

Despite not being a European Union member, Liechtenstein is part of the European Economic Area, where the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation could apply. This regulatory clarity could attract more crypto firms to the region.

Similar to Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, Lichtenstein is a small but thriving cryptocurrency hub in Europe. The Liechtenstein Blockchain Act, which passed in 2019, provided clear crypto regulation, with several crypto-focused businesses setting up operations in the country since.

The nation follows a similar course to the nearby Swiss communities of Zug and Lugano, which accept Bitcoin for some taxes and public services, with retailers, including the likes of McDonald’s, also accepting BTC.

Nonetheless, the sixth smallest nation in the world is cautious in its approach to investing in Bitcoin or crypto. Risch expressed that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are currently too risky for the country’s multibillion-dollar treasury, but the verdict may change in the future.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Similar to Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, Lichtenstein is a small but thriving cryptocurrency hub in Europe. The Liechtenstein Blockchain Act, which passed in 2019, provided clear crypto regulation, with several crypto-focused businesses setting up operations in the country since.

The nation follows a similar course to the nearby Swiss communities of Zug and Lugano, which accept Bitcoin for some taxes and public services, with retailers, including the likes of McDonald’s, also accepting BTC.

Nonetheless, the sixth smallest nation in the world is cautious in its approach to investing in Bitcoin or crypto. Risch expressed that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are currently too risky for the country’s multibillion-dollar treasury, but the verdict may change in the future.

This move by Liechtenstein coincides with a growing trend of smaller nations embracing cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

Worldcoin, a project to identify humans and distinguish them from artificial intelligence, has launched a gas-free crypto wallet for verified humans, according to a May 8 announcement. 

The new wallet, called “World App,” works on Android and iOS operating systems. It currently runs on the Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8745

 network, allowing users to hold and transfer United States Dollar Coin 

USDC

$1.00

, Dai (DAI), Ether 

ETH

$1,847

, Worldcoin (WLD) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

World App uses the project’s “World ID” system to discriminate between humans and bots. Users who want to take advantage of gas-free transfers must first register for a World ID by supplying a phone number or iris scan. Developers say the project doesn’t store users’ data. Instead, it generates a zero-knowledge proof to verify the user is human, but without revealing the data used to generate the proof.

Even users who don’t have a World ID can still use the app, but they can’t take advantage of the feeless transactions. The announcement said the app relies on account abstraction to allow for third-party gas payment.

The project has partnered with regulated crypto exchanges, including Moonpay and Ramp, to offer onboarding and offboarding within the wallet. Once coins are held in the wallet, they can be swapped through built-in Uniswap integration. Users can also connect their phone numbers to the app to send and receive crypto through phone contacts.

In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Worldcoin Core team member Tiago Sada stated that the wallet was created to offer a simple option for inexperienced crypto users.

“When we first started, we actually just went out with normal wallets, the wallets a power user like me would use day-to-day, and it turns out those were too overwhelming for normal people. There were too many options, too many things to do, [it was] not super clear,"" he said. ""We’re launching [World App] as a product so that there is this alternative wallet that is focused just on simplicity.”

Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, who also co-founded ChatGPT developer OpenAI.

Artificial intelligence has been growing at an unprecedented rate in recent years and is being integrated into a range of industries. But its rapid growth has sparked concern over job losses, as many tasks previously performed by humans could soon be automated by AI.

For example, on May 1, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told Bloomberg that 7,800 jobs at the firm could be replaced by AI and automation over the next five years, representing approximately 30% of its workforce.

While AI has the potential to improve efficiency, increase productivity and reduce costs, the rapid advancements seen in tools such as ChatGPT-4 — which represents a huge improvement on its predecessor, ChatGPT-3.5 — have many people concerned that their industry will be one of those hit hardest by related job losses.

ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) can already be used to complete a variety of tasks, such as generating smart contract code, handling community management, performing market analysis and more. 

A research report from professional services firm Accenture released in March refers to the growing popularity of ChatGPT as “AI’s first true inflection point in public adoption,” adding:

“Nearly every job will be impacted — some will be eliminated, most will be transformed, and many new jobs will be created.”

Accenture’s research found that 40% of working hours across various industries could be affected by LLMs and identified banking as the industry most likely to be affected, as 54% of tasks were found to have a high potential for automation, closely followed by insurance at 48%.

Replacement and synthesis

Cointelegraph asked Gary Marcus, an AI entrepreneur and co-author of the book Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust, what he thought about AI’s impact on various industries.

Marcus suggested that commercial artists may be most at risk. “Commercial art” refers to branding, logos, advertising and graphic design — generally, art used for commercial purposes. 

Commercial art is distinct from fine art, which refers to paintings, sculpture and photography — art that is more likely to be displayed at art museums such as the Louvre and is much harder for AI to create.

Marcus downplayed the prospect of job losses in the short term, however, noting that “in many cases, people will work together with machines, at least for [the] next several years.”

When asked how people can best future-proof their jobs to avoid being replaced by AI, Marcus replied: “It’s hard to know for sure, but I think that creative problem-solving skills and good critical thinking will remain valuable for a long time.”

The prospect of job losses due to AI is also something the World Economic Forum has been closely monitoring. It released its “Future of Jobs Report 2023” on April 30, which predicts that clerical or secretarial roles such as bank tellers and data entry clerks would be hit the hardest.

Echoing Marcus, the report indicates that higher-level skills such as analytical and creative thinking would be most in demand over the course of the next five years, and notes that the number-one training strategy for companies with more than 50,000 employees is to train their employees to efficiently use AI tools.

Job creation from AI

While the WEF report highlights that AI will likely replace many jobs, it notes that it will also create jobs and is merely contributing to an overall trend toward automation.

Accenture makes similar claims in its report, highlighting that many of the “language tasks” that could be automated by LLMs could be “transformed into more productive activity through augmentation and automation.”

A working paper released on March 27 by ChatGPT creator OpenAI and researchers from the University of Pennsylvania suggests that more hands-on professions such as cooks, mechanics and stonemasons were highly unlikely to be replaced by AI tools in the near future.

The paper also predicts that jobs that involved data or information processing, as well as those in the healthcare industry, are at much greater risk of automation, as programming and writing skills are more in line with the capabilities of LLMs like ChatGPT.

AI Eye: ‘Biggest ever’ leap in AI, cool new tools, AIs are the real DAOs

While the healthcare industry will still require many people for the more hands-on roles like nurses and surgeons, providers are increasingly using AI to analyze patient data, so many healthcare workers who are involved in data analysis could have their roles automated.

In all, there seems to be a consensus that clerical and other administrative roles will be the most heavily affected jobs over the next few years, and workers who are able to hone their creative/analytical thinking skills and become adept at using AI tools to boost their productivity will give themselves the best possible chance to not be replaced.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Tencent-backed Everledger collapses amid lack of funding: Report

Everledger was quietly placed into insolvency after it didn’t manage to materialize its planned funding round from an undisclosed investor.

The Australian blockchain company Everledger has reportedly entered insolvency proceedings after failing to raise new funding from an undisclosed investor.

Everledger, which uses blockchain to track the provenance of diamonds and other goods, failed to make its latest funding round happen, the AFR reported on May 8.

Subsequently, Everledger was quietly placed into voluntary administration as the firm could not pay its debts. All Everledger employees were given layoff notices on March 31, with Vincents Chartered Accountants being appointed as administrators on April 24. The first meeting of creditors was scheduled for May 8.

According to Everledger founder Leanne Kemp, the company’s management was forced to take this decision to protect the interests of shareholders.

“The second tranche of funding due to Everledger did not materialize, and subsequently, we understand that there are external reasons and pressures on this investor, which has meant Everledger was placed in a difficult and unexpected position,” Kemp said.

One of the critically important decisions was an immediate redundancy of employees and to hold the firm in control of administrators while its affairs were finalized, the founder added.

Kemp went on to say that Everledger planned its latest investment around the last external funding round required before profitability. “I would not suggest Everledger was a ‘cash burning’ startup,” she stated, adding:

“Certainly, our use of capital and operational footprint was in total alignment with the board’s direction under a controlled growth plan. This is not a company that scaled too fast or took on venture capital and burnt it in 18 months.”

Everledger did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

The company’s insolvency proceedings come despite Everledger being backed by major investors, including the Australian government and the Chinese internet giant Tencent.

In 2019, Tencent led Everledger’s Series A round with a $20 million investment. According to the AFR, Everledger also secured $3.5 million from the United Kingdom Government’s Future Fund in 2021. Over the past eight years, Everledger has reportedly raised $51.7 million in external investment.

Founded in 2015, Everledger is one of the world’s major companies pioneering blockchain-based platforms for tracking supply chains. Some companies, including the Danish logistics firm Maersk and the United States technology company IBM, have terminated their blockchain supply chain tracking products, citing a lack of “global industry collaboration.”

Despite major industry closures, the concept of blockchain-based supply chain platforms is still thriving in some parts of the world. Hong Kong-based Global Shipping Business Network continues building blockchain-based supply chain products and is bullish on blockchain as a crucial logistics tool in the long term.

The approval of the National Blockchain Policy for Nigeria has left the nation’s crypto community over the moon as it signals room for more development in the nation’s crypto industry. Some local experts have expressed their opinions about the implications of this new policy and the blockchain ecosystem in Nigeria.

The government of Nigeria approved a National Blockchain Policy during a meeting on May 3, 2023. A policy draft stated that blockchain and decentralized ledger technology would “facilitate the development of the Nigerian digital economy.” Cointelegraph contacted the local blockchain ecosystem to understand how the industry and the community accept the policy. 

Olajide Abiola, the co-founder and CEO of KiaKia — a Nigerian fintech company — expressed delight at the development. Olajide said the blockchain technology policy can potentially impact various areas of governance and policy-making in Nigeria.

He further stated that if the blockchain policy is leveraged correctly, it could help manage digital identity, creating a tamper-proof digital identity for citizens to authenticate and access government services securely. With the proper regulations, blockchain technology could also impact e-payments and billings in Nigeria, Olajide stated.

Considering that the technology is yet to be imbibed into the day-to-day activities of Nigerians, businesses can reduce costs and improve cash flow by offering secure and transparent payment options, with consumers benefiting from faster and more convenient transactions. This increased efficiency and convenience can lead to increased economic activity and growth.

The Federal Executive Council, alongside approving the policy, instructed relevant regulatory bodies to create regulatory frameworks for implementing blockchain technology in different sectors of the economy.

Local blockchain expert Barnette Akomolafe from the crypto exchange app M7pay also spoke about how great of a milestone it is for governments to recognize the potential of blockchain technology. According to Akomolafe, governments can encourage innovation and investment in blockchain technology through policies and regulations. This move could lead to economic growth and job creation for Nigerian youth.

Binance’s West and East Africa director, Nadeem Anjarwalla, commented that through the approval of the policy, Nigeria is positioning itself as a nation ahead of the curve, thereby supporting further blockchain innovation, user protection, security and economic competitiveness in the long term.

Anjarwalla commended the comprehensive approach taken in the reviewed policy document based on the six key initiatives, which include the establishment of Nigeria’s blockchain consortium, strengthening of the regulatory and legal framework, the focus of the provision of national digital identity, promotion of blockchain digital literacy and awareness, the creation of blockchain business incentive programs, and establishment of a national blockchain sandbox for proof of concepts and pilot implementation.

Nigeria is known to be one of the world’s most curious nations about cryptocurrencies.

PEPE’s sudden drop leaves whale 500K in the red

A memecoin whale who purchased roughly $3 million worth of the PEPE token just days ago is now sitting on an unrealized loss of around $600,000.

The price of new memecoin PEPE has plunged more than 42% only days after reaching its all-time high on May 6, leaving at least one investor with hundreds of thousands in paper losses. 

According to blockchain analytics service Lookonchain, one crypto “whale” purchased 962.3 billion PEPE using 70 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and 470 Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 for an average price of $0.000003122 on May 5.

PEPE has, however, fallen 42% from its all-time high since then, according to CoinGecko. The crypto investor’s PEPE holdings are now estimated to be worth only $2.4 million, marking an unrealized loss of more than $600,000.

Despite the recent price decline, PEPE still holds a market capitalization of just over $1 billion, making it the 45th-largest cryptocurrency by overall valuation.

Since its inception on April 14, PEPE has attracted widespread attention, witnessing over $636 million in trading volume within the last 24 hours, and single-handedly burning more than 5,000 ETH in related gas fees via Uniswap trading as of May 5.

While the memecoin has witnessed extreme volatility in its price, the number of individual holders has increased steadily over the past three weeks. According to data from Dune Analytics, there are 144,534 individual holders of tokens at the time of publication.

The advent of memecoin mania has also driven fees on the Bitcoin network to surge to their highest levels of the last two years, following an enormous spike in Bitcoin activity involving BRC-20-related transactions.

Memecoins have played a role in the cryptocurrency industry since the creation of the most widely recognized meme-based cryptocurrency, Dogecoin 

DOGE

, back in 2013. It’s worth pointing out that due to the inherent lack of any fundamentals, investment in memecoins can be an incredibly risky trading strategy, with vast sums of wealth being made and obliterated in equal measure.

Big Four accounting firm Deloitte has integrated blockchain technology to allow customers to store verification credentials in a single digital wallet to streamline the “typically inefficient” verification processes.

In a May 4 statement, Deloitte announced it has integrated KILT Protocol technology — a Polkadot parachain — to enable the issuance of reusable digital credentials to its customers. The integration aims to improve the efficiency of Deloitte’s Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) verification processes.

In the statement, Deloitte said the standard and “typically inefficient” processes, including KYC and KYB certificates being issued on paper, and identity verification requests requiring multiple data points when only one is needed, often create “extra work in the process.“

Additionally, these traditional verification procedures store data and personal information across multiple platforms and databases, placing consumer data privacy at risk. 

The credentials will serve various use cases, including regulatory compliance for banking and decentralized finance (DeFi), age verification for e-commerce, private logins and fundraising.

While the wallet will be stored on the customer’s device and remain under their control at all times, Deloitte retains the ability to modify if circumstances change, as noted in the statement:

“Credentials are digitally signed by Deloitte. Deloitte can revoke credentials using blockchain technology if conditions of the customer have changed after the credential was issued.”

The company added that no prior knowledge of blockchain is required from customers to set up the credential wallet.

KILT Protocol founder Ingo Rübe said that the streamlined identity solutions built on KILT allow customers to use verifiable digital credentials across multiple services while maintaining control “over when and where to share personal information.”

As a Polkadot parachain, it also provides the “scale and security needed by enterprise partners,” he added.

Polkadot tweeted shortly after the announcement on May 4, saying that Deloitte leveraging KILT’s solutions to support its KYC and KYB processes is vital for safeguarding itself against illegal activity.

This comes after reports on April 26 that there were over 300 crypto-related job opportunities available at Deloitte, with almost all of them being posted in the same week.

Meanwhile, searching for crypto-related job openings at the other Big Four accounting firms, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, showed no results.

Internet payment processor Stripe has introduced a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp to address the “cold start problem” faced by Web3 companies due to customers not having “crypto in their wallets to carry out transactions.”

According to a May 4 statement, Stripe’s newly launched fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, which Stripe itself will host, will allow Web3 companies to offer United States-based customers the ability to purchase crypto “at the precise moment they need it” without the need to embed any code into a website or app.

Instead, customers will be directed to a link to convert their fiat into crypto.

Guillaume Poncin, head of engineering for crypto at Stripe, said Stripe would handle several compliance-related tasks for Web3 companies using the on-ramp, including conversion and authorization optimization, identity verification and fraud prevention, to help “customers start using Web3 services quickly and safely.“

It was noted that built-in fraud detection and identity verification tools were implemented to support companies in meeting Know Your Customer and compliance requirements.

— Stripe (@stripe) May 4, 2023

Implementing the new on-ramp service aims to support Web3 companies by providing a user-friendly way for customers to top up their crypto wallets. It stated: 

“Companies interested in offering cryptocurrency and blockchain-enabled experiences often face a cold start problem: Their customers don’t have the crypto in their wallets to carry out transactions.”

Several Web3 companies, including privacy-focused browser Brave, decentralized finance protocol 1inch and blockchain protocol Lens Protocol, have already implemented Stripe’s fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, according to the statement.

James Mudgett, vice president of Web3 products at Brave, stated that the service will allow the platform to “reach new Web3 users.”

Meanwhile, 1inch co-founder Sergei Kunz highlighted the importance of building “bridges between Web2 and Web3,” adding that Stripe’s experience with Web3 companies makes it “well positioned to help.“

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Ohm Shah, co-founder of Wallet Guard, stated that Stripe’s new offering could “allow for many people to easily enter into Web3.”

However, Shah stressed the importance of conducting due diligence before purchasing digital assets, even if the customer is familiar with the company providing the fiat-to-crypto on-ramp. He noted:

“While on-ramping with Stripe to purchase your very first NFT [nonfungible token] can be exciting, it’s important to consider how easy it is to lose your assets as all it takes is one malicious signature.”

This comes after mobile payments service Venmo announced its own fiat-to-crypto payment service on April 28.

During an interview at Consensus 2023, PayPal executive Jose Fernandez da Ponte said the new feature would provide a use case for digital assets because now crypto will be used for “fast and free near-instant transfers between Venmo wallets and PayPal wallets, which is basically connecting two of the largest networks and wallets in the country.”

Meanwhile, Robinhood announced its fiat-to-crypto on-ramp at Consensus on April 27. Robinhood Connect allows users to purchase and sell crypto using a credit or debit card in their self-custody wallet or natively in decentralized applications.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

The government of Kazakhstan received 3.07 billion tenges (approximately $7 million) in tax payments from crypto mining entities in 2022 following the implementation of an amended law regulating the fiscal burden of mining cryptocurrencies, according to local media reports.

Preliminary data from the government for 2023 shows that mining fees collected by April 27 totaled 240 million tenges, over $541,000 at the time of writing. The figures are much lower than the 652 million tenge (~$1.5 million) in fees paid in the first quarter of 2022. 

Kazakhstan ranks among the world’s top Bitcoin mining hubs. As of January 2022, the Central Asian country contributed 13.22% of the total Bitcoin hash rate, just behind the United States (37.84%) and China (21.11%), according to data from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.

The country introduced taxes on digital mining on January 1, 2022, based on electricity consumption by mining entities. The law came into effect amid growing national frustration with crypto miners’ undertaxed usage of the national power grid, Cointelegraph reported. The amended legislation was also considered a legal path for further adoption amid tightening regulations worldwide.

A wave of foreign mining operators relocated to Kazakhstan during the 2021 bull market, impacting already tricky relations between the country and miners. Some estimates indicate that more than 87,849 rigs had been brought to the territory by November 2021 following China’s crackdown on mining activities.

Recently, the government announced plans to introduce new crypto regulations to curb tax fraud and unlawful business operations. One of the proposals calls for government approval for secured digital assets issuers, while another would require miners to sell at least 75% of crypto earned via registered exchanges. The move is expected to reduce tax evasion.

Whether you’re looking to reduce debt, save for a down payment on a house or plan for retirement, ChatGPT can provide valuable guidance and support to help you achieve financial stability and security.

Budgeting

Budgeting is one of the most crucial components of personal financial management. Advice and tools for budgeting can be found on ChatGPT. With the help of individualized budgeting guidance, ChatGPT can assess one’s earnings and outgoings and offer tailored suggestions for how to make and adhere to a budget that suits their needs. In order to help individuals manage their money more skillfully, ChatGPT can also suggest budgeting tools and resources, such as websites or mobile apps.

For example, if you’re struggling to keep track of your spending, ChatGPT can suggest tools and apps help you monitor your expenses and stick to a budget. If you’re unsure about how much to allocate to different categories, such as housing, transportation and entertainment, ChatGPT can offer advice based on your income and priorities. Additionally, ChatGPT can provide reminders and alerts to help you stay on track with your budget and avoid overspending.

Investment advice

Investing is a vital component of managing one’s finances. Based on one’s financial objectives, risk tolerance and other considerations, ChatGPT can advise on investments to consider.

For instance, ChatGPT can advise on the best stocks, cryptocurrencies or mutual funds to consider. ChatGPT can also suggest techniques for diversifying a portfolio of investments to minimize risk and optimize rewards.

The AI tool can also provide alerts and updates on market trends and fluctuations, helping users make informed decisions about when to buy or sell investments.

Debt management

Debt management is essential for maintaining financial stability and is often a significant source of stress for many people. ChatGPT can provide guidance on how to lower one’s debt and better manage finances.

For instance, ChatGPT can advise on negotiating lower interest rates or combining debt to make payments more reasonable if users are having trouble paying off credit card debt. One can prioritize which bills to pay off first by learning more about debt repayment strategies like the debt snowball and debt avalanche from ChatGPT.

Debt snowball involves paying off debts in the smallest to largest balance, while debt avalanche consists of paying off debts in the highest to the lowest interest rate. Both methods can be effective in helping pay off debt, but which one to choose may depend on one’s preferences and financial situation.

Also, ChatGPT may offer advice on avoiding additional debt in the future by giving pointers on how to raise one’s credit score, manage money more wisely and refrain from overspending.

Savings and retirement planning

Personal financial management includes both saving money and making plans for retirement. ChatGPT can provide guidance on how to budget for both immediate and long-term objectives, such as retirement or a down payment on a home.

For instance, one can inquire about how much money to put away each month or which savings accounts have the highest interest rates using ChatGPT. In addition, ChatGPT can suggest methods for budgeting and saving for retirement, such as making contributions to an IRA or 401(k).

SEC issues record whistleblower award of $279M

The $279 million figure is more than all of the whistleblower awards issued for 2022, with the SEC dishing out $229 million across 103 awards last year.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued its largest-ever whistleblower award totaling $279 million.

The SEC generally issues awards ranging between 10% to 30% of collected monetary sanctions larger than $1 million. To receive such an award, the whistleblower must provide information that directly assists the SEC in successfully imposing enforcement actions on a particular case.

In a May 5 statement, the SEC noted that the $279 million awarded to the unnamed whistleblower was more than double the previous record of $114 million from back in October 2020.

Additionally, the $279 million figure awarded in this latest case is more than all of the whistleblower awards issued for 2022, with the SEC dishing out $229 million across 103 awards last year.

Today we announced the largest-ever award, nearly $279 million to a whistleblower whose information and assistance led to the successful enforcement of SEC and related actions.https://t.co/GGwiZ4BQUf

— U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 5, 2023

“The size of today’s award — the highest in our program’s history — not only incentivizes whistleblowers to come forward with accurate information about potential securities law violations, but also reflects the tremendous success of our whistleblower program,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement.

These awards come from an investor protection fund established by the U.S. Congress. It is funded via collected monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators and does not come from funds that are owed to harmed investors.

In these circumstances, the SEC does not refer to the specific case the whistleblower award relates to or the name of the whistleblower to protect their privacy.

As such, it is unclear if this relates to a major securities violation from the crypto sector or Wall Street.

Regarding the whistleblower, the SEC did note that they helped provide key info on a case it was already working on.

“The whistleblower’s sustained assistance, including multiple interviews and written submissions, was critical to the success of these actions,” noted Creola Kelly, the chief of the SEC’s office of the whistleblower.

“While the whistleblower’s information did not prompt the opening of the Commission’s investigation, their information expanded the scope of misconduct charged,” she added.

The SEC’s whistleblower incentive program was established in mid-2010 under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was signed into law by former President Barack Obama.

HOW TO
Join us on social networks

A transaction on the Ethereum blockchain is technically initiated by an external account owner (not a contract). For example, if User A sends 1 Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 to User B, the action of debiting from one account and crediting to another changes the blockchain’s state.

The change specifically takes place on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Ethereum transactions need to be broadcast to the entire network, and any node can broadcast a request for the execution of a transaction on the EVM.

After broadcasting the request, a validator can then execute the transaction and propagate the state change to the whole network. Transaction fees are incurred during the process of validation, and each transaction must be included in a validated block. There are different types of transactions on the Ethereum network:

Regular transactions: transactions occurring from one account to another.
Contract-execution transactions: transactions interacting with deployed smart contracts (the “to” address is a smart contract address).
Contract-deployment transactions: transactions with no “to” address (the data field is simply used to deploy the smart contract’s code).
How to check the status of an Ethereum transaction

Here’s a brief step-by-step guide on how to track Ethereum transactions:

Step 1: Select an Ethereum blockchain explorer

Some blockchain explorers are specific to Ethereum, such as Etherscan, Ethplorer and EthVM. Others support multiple chains, such as Blockchain.com and Tokenview, among others.

Step 2: Enter the transaction hash into the blockchain explorer’s search field

On Etherscan, for example, the search field is on the top, left-hand corner of the screen next to a dropdown that says “All Filters.” Depending on the tool, a user can search for information based on a wallet address, transaction hash (txid), block, token or domain name.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

The txid is a unique identifier attached to a specific transaction. All transactions carried out on-chain, or those to and from external addresses, carry a unique txid found in the transaction details.

Depending on the platform, it can also be called a “hash” or “txn hash.” It usually looks like a string of random letters and numbers. On MetaMask, for example, a user can instantly see the txid upon clicking the “Activity” tab and selecting the transaction.

Other than the txid, traders can also use their public address (a string of 42 characters corresponding to their public account). In this case, they will be taken to an overview of their wallet activities, allowing them to navigate to the specific transaction independently.

Step 3: Click the icon for “search” or “enter” on the blockchain explorer

Step 4: Check if the transaction was successful or not

How to know if an ETH transaction was successful: Details indicating the state of the transaction will appear on the blockchain explorer. If the transaction was successfully validated and is now on the blockchain, it will say “success” or “successful.”

If there are no errors displayed, it means that the transaction was completed successfully. The ETH should be credited to the destination wallet or exchange account within 24 hours of sending.

In the event of an Ether transaction failure, on the other hand, several error messages can appear:

Error message or symbol: A red exclamation point or an error message saying “bad instruction” or “out of gas” means that the transaction was unsuccessful and the funds did not reach their intended destination. In the case of an “out of gas” error, users can double the gas limit they initially specified and try again.
Reverted: This pertains to a smart contract user error. It means that the user should double-check the details of the transaction.
Transaction not found: Either the transaction did not go through or it isn’t appearing on the blockchain explorer yet. Try using another explorer. If it still doesn’t appear on multiple ones, there’s a good chance it did not go through.
Pending: The transaction is still waiting to be validated or processed, but it was located in the explorer’s transaction pool. Sometimes pending transactions can still be canceled or replaced by a user.

How long does an Ethereum transaction take to process?

An average transaction on the Ethereum blockchain will typically take between 15 seconds and five minutes to process, depending on several factors. These include the amount paid to process it (transaction fee) and how busy the network is at the time of processing.

Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain after the Merge. However, transaction speeds remain roughly the same. According to the Ethereum Foundation, it’s a common misconception that the Merge drastically sped up transactions.

However, there’s a slight difference, with slots occurring precisely every 12 seconds post-Merge compared with every 13.3 seconds pre-Merge. In any case, the change is barely noticeable by most users, as processing still usually depends on network congestion and transaction fees.

When a transaction is initiated, it is logged into Ethereum’s memory pool (mempool) and waits for validators to pick it up. The mempool functions much like a waiting room where pending transactions are held.

Once a validator enters transaction data into a block and adds the block to the blockchain, the transaction is considered complete. It is said to be finalized and irreversible after six additional blocks have been mined and added on top of it.

By checking a transaction’s status, traders can confirm whether their transaction has succeeded or failed and how many blocks have been created since their transaction was added to the chain.

Why should traders check a transaction’s status?

Ethereum participants must pay gas fees to use the network to transfer funds or deploy smart contracts. The fees largely depend on the number of participants waiting to execute transactions at a given time.

Network congestion and demand are thus directly proportional to transaction costs. When demand is high, costs rise — the opposite is true when demand is low. In any case, checking a transaction’s status helps a trader monitor the cost of using the network.

It can also help users determine if the gas fee they paid is sufficient to have their transaction confirmed. Low gas fees can usually truncate or delay transactions, leaving them to remain pending for long periods of time, especially during high network congestion.

Such transactions will remain pending until the gas fees reach the required minimum fees on the network. If this happens, a user can resend the transaction by resubmitting it and increasing the gas fee while ensuring it carries the same nonce.

In addition to transaction status, Ethereum blockchain explorers can also reveal the following helpful information:

Timestamp: the date and time the transaction was added to the blockchain.
Block confirmations: the number of blocks mined since the transaction was confirmed.
Transaction fee: the fee paid to the miner or validator.
ETH price: the price of ETH at the time of processing.
Base fee: the lowest fee required to transact on Ethereum.
Gas limit: the maximum amount of gas the sender is allocating to process the transaction.
Nonce: a unique number marking each transaction executed on a user’s wallet; it increases by one each time a new transaction is sent.

By being aware of the above, traders can stay on top of their ETH transactions and make sure transactions are processed correctly and quickly. This helps to ensure smooth Ethereum transactions when sending and receiving funds or deploying smart contracts. Understanding a transaction’s status can also help users adjust their spending habits and optimize network usage.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued its largest-ever whistleblower award totaling $279 million.

The SEC generally issues awards ranging between 10% to 30% of collected monetary sanctions larger than $1 million. To receive such an award, the whistleblower must provide information that directly assists the SEC in successfully imposing enforcement actions on a particular case.

In a May 5 statement, the SEC noted that the $279 million awarded to the unnamed whistleblower was more than double the previous record of $114 million from back in October 2020.

Additionally, the $279 million figure awarded in this latest case is more than all of the whistleblower awards issued for 2022, with the SEC dishing out $229 million across 103 awards last year.

“The size of today’s award — the highest in our program’s history — not only incentivizes whistleblowers to come forward with accurate information about potential securities law violations, but also reflects the tremendous success of our whistleblower program,” said Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement.

These awards come from an investor protection fund established by the U.S. Congress. It is funded via collected monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators and does not come from funds that are owed to harmed investors.

In these circumstances, the SEC does not refer to the specific case the whistleblower award relates to or the name of the whistleblower to protect their privacy.

As such, it is unclear if this relates to a major securities violation from the crypto sector or Wall Street.

Regarding the whistleblower, the SEC did note that they helped provide key info on a case it was already working on.

“The whistleblower’s sustained assistance, including multiple interviews and written submissions, was critical to the success of these actions,” noted Creola Kelly, the chief of the SEC’s office of the whistleblower.

“While the whistleblower’s information did not prompt the opening of the Commission’s investigation, their information expanded the scope of misconduct charged,” she added.

The SEC’s whistleblower incentive program was established in mid-2010 under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was signed into law by former President Barack Obama. The law also simultaneously established a similar program for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

According to a statement from the monetary authority, payment providers may not offer or facilitate crypto services through their applications. The move brings payment fintechs and financial institutions under the same rules in the country.

""Payment service providers that offer payment accounts [...] may not carry out or facilitate operations with digital assets, including crypto assets, that are not regulated by the competent national authority and authorized by the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic,"" said the authority. Cryptocurrencies are not regulated in Argentina, which means all coins and tokens are subject to the decision.

It's unclear how the measure will affect the local crypto industry. Local media reported that payment providers refused to comment on the decision. Argentina's fintech chamber urged the government to reconsider the decision, claiming that ""it limits access to a technology that offers multiple benefits and opportunities for our society.""

Hyperinflation is driving crypto adoption in Argentina. In April, the price of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,596

 reached a record high in the Argentine peso (ARS), with the BTC exchange rate crossing over 6.59 million ARS — up more than 100% year-to-date.

In March, inflation in the country soared by 104.3% on an annual basis, following a 102.5% jump in the previous month, data from the national statistics office show.

Bitcoin’s popularity in the country also coincides with the ongoing devaluation of the Argentine peso, Cointelegraph reported. The currency has fallen almost 50% against the United States dollar in the past year.

Amid the ongoing economic crisis, even some Argentinian cities are seeking a safe haven in cryptocurrencies. Last December, the Argentine province of San Luis allowed the issuance of its own stablecoin pegged to the U.S dollar, available to all residents and 100% collateralized with liquid financial assets.

Chainalysis found that over 30% of consumers in Argentina use stablecoins for everyday purchases, most likely for small retail transactions under $1,000.

United States inflation and how it might affect the price of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,596

 are two of the top concerns on investors’ minds around the world. To illustrate, one prominent crypto personality bet big bucks on the future of the U.S. economy: the former Coinbase executive recently paid out $1.5 million to settle a Twitter wager about possible hyperinflation in the American economy.

The U.S. may not be experiencing hyperinflation, but the possibility of prices going out of control seems to concern the Federal Reserve. The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point on May 3 — to the highest level in 16 years — pushing the target range for its benchmark from 5% to 5.25%.

As inflation pressures continue, Bitcoin is still seen as a safe haven for many, with crypto firms weighing on the digital currency to fight back inflation and turmoil in mainstream finance.

This week’s Crypto Biz explores the latest wild wager on Bitcoin prices, inflation fears and the jobs that artificial intelligence may soon replace.

Balaji pays out his crazy $1 million Bitcoin bet, 97% under price target

A closely watched wager between former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan and pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock has been closed, with Srinivasan paying $1.5 million to settle. The wager commenced on March 17 when Medlock offered to bet anyone $1 million that the United States would not experience hyperinflation. A few hours later, the former Coinbase executive accepted the bet, claiming that an impending crisis would lead to the deflation of the U.S. dollar and, thus, to a hyperinflation scenario, taking the BTC price to $1 million. As part of the deal, Srinivasan paid Medlock $500,000, donated $500,000 to Bitcoin core developers and gave an additional $500,000 to the nonprofit charity, Give Directly.

MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin conviction ‘strong’ as it posts Q1 profit

The Bitcoin investment strategy is as strong as ever at business intelligence platform MicroStrategy after the company posted its first quarterly profit since 2020. The firm returned to the green with a profit of $94 million, primarily attributed to a one-time income tax benefit of $453.2 million. The firm further reduced its leverage by repaying a $161 million Bitcoin-backed loan from the now-collapsed Silverage Bank. The quarterly results were also impacted by a revenue rise of 2.2% from last year to $121.9 million. MicroStrategy’s CEO Phong Lee said the firm would continue to execute its dual strategy of growing business intelligence software and acquiring Bitcoin. The firm believes its Bitcoin thesis is a “pretty good way to outperform the market.”

Coinbase stock will be ‘weighed down’ until US rules are clear: Citi

Coinbase’s stock price will continue to be “weighed down” until regulators establish the legal “rules of the road” in the United States, Citi analysts say. The bank downgraded shares of the crypto exchange from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered its price target, citing “too many unknowns” as the company battles it out with regulators. However, bearish sentiment on Coinbase’s stock is not stopping investment firm ARK Invest from increasing its exposure to the crypto exchange. ARK purchased 168,869 Coinbase shares for its exchange-traded funds on May 1, worth nearly $8.5 million. In April, ARK bagged 304,300 shares worth $17.5 million. Previously, the firm bought 2.4 million shares in March for about $117 million.

Citi's analysis was published prior to Coinbase's Q1 earnings report released on May 4.

7,800 jobs at IBM could be replaced by AI within years, CEO suggests

IBM is expecting to put a “pause” on hiring for “back-office” roles that could be potentially automated by artificial intelligence instead. According to the company CEO, Arvind Krishna, back-office positions, such as those in human resources and accounting departments, will likely be the first to be automated by AI. Nearly 30% of these positions will “easily” be replaced by AI over five years, claimed Krishna in an interview. IBM employs 282,000 employees globally, according to LinkedIn data. Non-customer-facing staff sits at nearly 26,000.

"Will AI talent marketplaces replace traditional employment models?","Discover how AI talent marketplaces are transforming the job market and disrupting traditional employment models.","1.
What are AI talent marketplaces, and how do they work?

AI talent marketplaces are online platforms that connect businesses with skilled AI professionals. 

Artificial intelligence (AI) talent marketplaces are a relatively new concept that is gaining popularity due to the growing demand for AI-related skills in the job market. They act as intermediaries between businesses and AI professionals, providing a platform for businesses to find the right talent for automation-related tasks. These marketplaces offer a variety of services, ranging from matching businesses with suitable AI professionals to providing training and resources for AI professionals. 

The way AI talent marketplaces work involves several steps. Businesses post their AI-related projects on the platform, specifying the skills and expertise required for the project. AI professionals create their profiles on the platform, highlighting their skills, experience and project portfolios.

The AI talent marketplace then uses automated algorithms to match businesses with suitable AI professionals based on their project requirements and the AI professionals’ skills and experience. Once a match is made, the AI talent marketplace facilitates communication between the human resource and the AI professional, and the project is carried out. 

Compared to traditional recruitment processes, AI marketplaces provide a number of benefits. They make it easy for businesses to find the best experts for their projects by giving them access to a global pool of AI talent.

No matter where candidates are located, companies can discover the most capable professionals thanks to this global talent pool. Kaggle, for example, is an online platform that has a global community of data scientists and machine learning professionals, and it enables businesses to find and communicate with top talent on various data science projects.

2.
How are traditional employment models being disrupted by AI talent marketplaces?

AI marketplaces link businesses with qualified individuals from all over the world by utilizing machine learning and other AI technologies.

AI talent markets are fundamentally changing how traditional employment models operate by giving businesses more flexibility and agility in their recruiting procedures. Businesses may use independent contractors or freelance talent rather than depending on full-time staff, enabling them to easily scale up or down their workforce as necessary to meet shifting demands. 

This shift toward a more flexible workforce also benefits the AI talent themselves, who are able to work on a wider variety of projects and with different companies, gaining valuable experience and exposure to diverse industries. AI talent marketplaces are thus revolutionizing the way businesses approach talent acquisition and the nature of work itself.

In today’s fast-paced and continuously changing business environment, this gives organizations access to a larger range of talents and knowledge than they would be able to obtain in their local job market, offering them a competitive advantage.

Another way that AI talent marketplaces are reshaping traditional employment frameworks is by encouraging a more meritocratic approach to talent selection. Rather than relying on traditional credentials like degrees or job experience, these markets capitalize on sophisticated algorithms and other AI tools to evaluate individuals based on their talents, performance history and other relevant variables. 

This approach not only opens up opportunities for talented individuals who may have been overlooked by traditional hiring methods, but it also promotes a more diverse and inclusive workforce. By prioritizing skills and performance over traditional credentials, AI talent marketplaces are helping to break down barriers to entry and provide opportunities for individuals from a wider range of backgrounds to showcase their abilities and succeed in their careers.

This can help to eliminate bias and other types of discrimination from the recruiting process, ensuring that the best individuals are chosen based on their talents and potential, rather than their background or other irrelevant factors.

Additionally, these marketplaces are assisting in closing the skills gap (the difference between the skills that employers need and the skills that job candidates possess) that exists in many sectors today. These markets assist people to upskill and reskill themselves by offering access to training and development tools, ensuring that they remain competitive and employable in a continually changing employment market. This, in turn, may contribute to increased economic growth and prosperity by ensuring that firms have access to the people they require to innovate, expand and flourish.

3.
What are the benefits and drawbacks of AI talent marketplaces?

AI talent marketplaces offer access to a global pool of skilled professionals for cost-effective and flexible hiring. However, quality control, lack of commitment, security risks and communication barriers are potential drawbacks that organizations must consider when hiring freelance AI professionals through these platforms. 

AI talent marketplaces are essentially platforms that connect organizations with freelance or self-employed AI professionals who can work on their projects independently. While this approach has its benefits, it also has its drawbacks compared to traditional employment models. Let’s take a closer look at both. 

Benefits of AI talent marketplaces 
Access to a large pool of talent: AI talent marketplaces provide access to a large pool of skilled professionals from around the world, making it easier for companies to find the right talent for their specific projects. 
Cost-effective: Hiring freelance AI professionals through talent marketplaces can be more cost-effective than hiring full-time employees. Companies only pay for the specific project or work required, without having to bear the overhead costs associated with full-time employees. 
Flexibility: AI talent marketplaces provide flexibility in terms of project duration, allowing companies to hire professionals for short-term projects or specific tasks, without having to commit to a long-term employment contract. 
Diverse perspectives: AI talent marketplaces provide access to a diverse range of perspectives and expertise, as professionals from different backgrounds and countries can collaborate on projects. 

Related: Remote work could redefine the global workforce for good

Drawbacks of AI talent marketplaces 
Quality control: It can be challenging to ensure the quality of work delivered by freelance AI professionals through talent marketplaces, especially when working remotely. This can lead to potential issues with the quality of the end product. 
Lack of commitment: Freelance AI professionals hired through talent marketplaces may not be as committed to the organization as full-time employees, as they may have other clients and projects to work on simultaneously. 
Security risks: Hiring freelance AI professionals through talent marketplaces can also pose security risks, as sensitive information may be shared with individuals who are not part of the organization’s network. 
Communication barriers: Working with freelance AI professionals from different countries and cultures can lead to communication barriers, which can affect the quality of work and the overall project outcome.
4.
How can regulatory frameworks keep up with the rise of AI talent marketplaces?

As AI talent marketplaces continue to grow and disrupt traditional employment models, it is important for regulatory frameworks to keep up and ensure ethical and fair practices. 

The rise of AI talent marketplaces presents a unique challenge for regulators, as these platforms often operate across national borders and involve a diverse range of stakeholders such as platform operators, investors, government bodies and more.

One of the main challenges for regulators is ensuring that AI talent marketplaces give fair access to all users, regardless of their background or location. This includes ensuring that job listings are not discriminatory and that all users have equal access to job opportunities. Furthermore, authorities must guarantee that these AI marketplaces are transparent in their use of personal data and that users are adequately educated about the risks and benefits of utilizing these platforms.

Another key challenge for regulators is ensuring that AI talent marketplaces adhere to existing employment laws and regulations. This might involve ensuring that workers are appropriately classified as employees or independent contractors and that they are paid fairly and get enough benefits. Furthermore, authorities must guarantee that AI talent marketplaces comply with tax laws and other legal obligations, such as those relating to worker safety and health.

To overcome these issues, legal frameworks must be versatile and adaptable in response to the changing landscape of AI talent marketplaces. A possible approach may be to create a set of industry-specific standards or guidelines that serve as a foundation for ethical and fair practices. These guidelines guarantee that these rules represent the requirements and concerns of all parties and must be produced in consultation with industry players, such as AI talent marketplaces, employees and labor unions.

Regulators can also use existing legal frameworks, such as antitrust laws and data protection regulations, to ensure that AI talent marketplaces do not engage in anti-competitive behavior or violate users’ privacy rights. For example, regulators could investigate allegations of price-fixing or collusion among AI talent marketplaces or require these platforms to obtain explicit consent from users before using their personal data for marketing purposes. 

Related: Here’s how blockchain and AI combine to redefine data security

Finally, authorities may encourage more transparency and accountability in AI talent marketplaces by forcing these platforms to provide details about their algorithms, data sources and decision-making processes. This can include regulating AI talent marketplaces to explain automated decisions and allowing users to challenge these results if they think the outcomes are unfair or discriminating.

5.
What does the future hold for AI talent marketplaces and traditional employment models?

As artificial intelligence continues to progress and become more prominent in the workplace, it is logical to wonder what the future holds for AI talent marketplaces as well as traditional employment models.

One thing is certain: AI talent marketplaces are here to stay. According to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com, the artificial intelligence industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 36.2% from $86.9 billion in 2022 to $407.0 billion by 2027. This growth is driven by the increasing adoption of AI technologies in various industries and the need for businesses to keep up with the pace of technological change. 

As AI talent marketplaces continue to grow, traditional employment models are likely to be disrupted even further. In the past, people typically found jobs through traditional means such as networking, job boards or recruitment agencies. 

However, AI talent marketplaces are changing the game by connecting businesses with skilled professionals from all over the world, making it easier for businesses to find the talent they need quickly and efficiently. For example, Codementor connects coders with mentors for coding assistance and also offers a freelance platform where clients can post job requests and coders can apply for projects.

Another trend that is likely to continue is the increasing use of AI in recruitment and talent management. AI-powered tools like Textio can analyze job descriptions and candidate resumes, match job seekers with open positions, and even conduct initial interviews. This not only saves time and resources for businesses, but it also helps ensure that candidates are matched with jobs that align with their skills and interests. 

Despite the many benefits of AI talent marketplaces, traditional employment models are unlikely to disappear entirely. There will always be some jobs that require a physical presence or that cannot be performed remotely. 

Healthcare professionals, construction workers and emergency responders are some examples of jobs that require physical presence and cannot be performed remotely. Additionally, many people still prefer the stability and benefits that come with traditional employment, such as health insurance and retirement plans. 

Another factor that will shape the future of AI talent marketplaces is the ongoing debate around the impact of AI on jobs. While some argue that AI will lead to widespread job loss, others believe that it will create new jobs and opportunities. The truth likely lies somewhere in between, with AI disrupting some industries while creating new ones. 

Regardless, the rise of AI talent marketplaces is changing the world of work in significant ways. While traditional employment models are unlikely to disappear entirely, they will continue to be disrupted by the growth of AI talent marketplaces and the increasing use of AI in recruitment and talent management. The future of work will be shaped by many factors, including the ongoing evolution of AI technologies, changing attitudes toward work and employment, and the regulatory frameworks that are put in place to govern these platforms.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/will-ai-talent-marketplaces-replace-traditional-employment-models"

OVERVIEW
Join us on social networks

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to improve credit scoring in a number of ways. Credit scoring is the process of assessing a borrower’s creditworthiness based on their credit history, financial data and other relevant factors. Here are some ways AI can improve credit scoring:

Advertisement

Better data analysis

AI can analyze large volumes of data from a variety of sources to identify patterns and trends that might not be apparent to human analysts. This can help lenders make more accurate predictions about a borrower’s creditworthiness. The below steps illustrate how AI can be used for data analysis:

Collect data from various sources, such as social media, credit bureaus and financial statements.
Pre-process and clean the data to ensure it’s ready for analysis.
Apply machine learning algorithms to the data to identify patterns and trends.
Use the insights gained from the analysis to inform lending decisions.
Improved risk assessment

AI can be used to build predictive models that assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. These models can take into account a wide range of factors, such as income, debt-to-income ratio and payment history, to better predict the risk associated with lending to a particular borrower.

The general steps followed by lenders to assess borrower’s suitability for credit are listed below:

Collect data about the borrower, such as credit history, income, employment status and other relevant factors.
Pre-process and clean the data to ensure it’s ready for analysis.
Train machine learning models on the data to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan.
Use the models to assess the risk associated with lending to a particular borrower.
Reduced bias

AI can help reduce bias in credit scoring by using objective criteria to assess creditworthiness. This can help reduce the impact of factors such as race, gender and ethnicity on lending decisions.

One of the challenges in credit scoring is ensuring that the process is fair and free from bias. Historically, lending decisions have been influenced by factors such as race, gender and ethnicity, which can result in discriminatory practices. However, with the use of AI, it’s possible to reduce the impact of these factors on lending decisions.

To achieve this, lenders need to identify potential sources of bias in the credit scoring process, such as race, gender and ethnicity. They can then train machine learning models to exclude or de-emphasize these factors in the lending decision process. By doing so, lenders can make more objective and fair lending decisions that are based on the borrower’s creditworthiness rather than personal characteristics.

However, it is critical to note that AI is not immune to bias, and it’s crucial to monitor the models for any signs of bias and adjust them as needed to ensure fairness and transparency. This necessitates constant model monitoring and assessment, as well as routine evaluations of the training data. By doing so, lenders are able to guarantee that their credit score system is impartial and equal for all borrowers, regardless of their racial, gender or cultural background.

Faster processing

AI can significantly improve the speed and efficiency of the credit scoring process. Traditionally, credit scoring has been a manual and time-consuming process, involving a lot of paperwork and human intervention. However, with the use of AI, lenders can automate many of the tasks involved in credit scoring, reducing processing times and increasing efficiency.

One of the ways AI can speed up the credit scoring process is by automating data entry and analysis. By using machine learning algorithms to process and analyze large volumes of data, lenders can quickly assess a borrower’s creditworthiness and make lending decisions in real-time. This can be especially useful for online lending platforms that require fast and accurate credit assessments.

Another way AI can improve the speed of credit scoring is by automating the loan application process. By using chatbots and other AI-powered tools, lenders can provide borrowers with instant feedback on their loan applications, reducing the time and effort required to apply for a loan.

Improved customer experience

 AI-powered credit scoring can provide borrowers with a more personalized lending experience. For example, lenders can use AI to offer borrowers loan products that are tailored to their specific needs and financial situations. The lenders typically follow the steps below to enhance the borrower’s experience:

Collect data about the borrower, such as their financial goals and risk tolerance.
Use machine learning algorithms to identify loan products that match the borrower’s needs and preferences.
Offer personalized loan products to the borrower based on the analysis.

Will Biden’s plan to tax crypto mining reduce emissions? Critics say no

The tax is intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, electricity costs and local environmental pollution, but has not been kindly received by the crypto community.

Cryptocurrency miners based in the United States could soon face a tax equal to 30% of the cost of electricity they use if President Joe Biden’s proposed budget for the fiscal year 2024 is approved by Congress, but the proposal has sparked debate about whether it would actually decrease global emissions and energy prices.

Cryptocurrency mining is a resource-intensive process that attempts to solve increasingly complex equations in order to create new blocks which can then be validated and added to the blockchain.

This process consumes a significant amount of energy, with some estimates placing the global energy consumption of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,596

 mining alone at around 0.59% of the world's energy usage, which is roughly equivalent to the energy usage of Malaysia, according to Worldometer.

Biden’s  Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), argues that the tax — dubbed the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax — “encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,” adding:

“Estimated to raise $3.5 billion in revenue over 10 years, the primary goal of the DAME tax is to start having cryptominers pay their fair share of the costs imposed on local communities and the environment.”

By imposing a tax on electricity usage crypto miners will have a financial incentive to reduce their energy consumption, and with electricity generation making up such a large proportion of carbon emissions, this should theoretically reduce emissions in the U.S.

This idea is similar to the thinking behind carbon taxes, which are intended to disincentivize emitters by forcing them to pay the full social cost of their emissions after attempting to factor in costs associated with polluting.

Leakage

However, opponents of the tax argue that it will simply drive miners offshore to countries with lower tax rates and less stringent environmental regulations, where they will continue to emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. This situation is known as “carbon leakage,” whereby emissions are simply shifted from one location to another, rather than reduced overall.

As Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter points out, these countries may also have a much lower proportion of energy supplied by renewable sources, so emissions may even increase as crypto miners move offshore.

Hey @hboushey46 /CEA/White House – when you try to ban Bitcoin mining here in the U.S., this is who you directly empower. Unplug them here, plug them into the much dirtier Kazakh grid. Great policy proposal, you've really thought this one through https://t.co/M4uSSHSxqa

— nic carter (@nic__carter) May 3, 2023

Carter was scathing in his critique of the policy, arguing that it would decrease tax revenue contrary to what the Biden administration suggests, increase carbon emissions, and empower “geopolitical enemies.”

Ever sat down and thought: how can I direct more money to my geopolitical enemies, lose tax revenue domestically, AND pump more CO2 into the atmosphere?

Well the DAME tax does that

— nic carter (@nic__carter) May 3, 2023

In its blog post, the CEA noted that “the potential for cryptomining to relocate abroad — such as to areas with dirtier energy production — is a concern” but suggested that other countries are also moving to restrict crypto mining, and cited nine countries that already had banned the activity.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, environmental group Greenpeace USA's Bitcoin project lead Joshua Archer warned that regulations or taxes deterring crypto mining will likely be created wherever crypto miners move to, and argued that Bitcoin should eliminate its proof-of-work consensus mechanism.

The climate activism group has been calling for Bitcoin to transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism as part of its ongoing “change the code, not the climate” campaign which began early last year. 

One of the countries referred to by the CEA, China, banned crypto mining in 2021 after citing concerns about its electricity consumption and environmental impact. However, studies on the effect of the ban suggest that activity had simply moved to countries that use far less renewable energy, and actually increased global emissions.

The CEA also argued that crypto miner's electricity usage drives up costs for other consumers, and increases overall reliance on “dirtier sources of electricity.”

Cryptominers’ intense and volatile power consumption can also push up electricity prices and make local electrical grids riskier as a result of increased strain on equipment, service interruptions and safety hazards. 6/ https://t.co/dN4vtqjHch

— Council of Economic Advisers (@WhiteHouseCEA) May 2, 2023

While this makes sense according to economic theory, as an increase in demand within a market leads to higher prices, it may overlook some important nuances of the crypto-mining industry and its effect on the electricity market in the U.S.

‘Beauty of Bitcoin’

Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings’s CEO Fred Thiel told Cointelegraph that “The beauty of Bitcoin mining is that it naturally incentivizes renewable energy generation.”

Thiel elaborated that “In many cases, green energy sources — such as solar and wind farms — are only feasible if there is consistent demand for that energy when it is produced,” adding:

“While most consumers’ energy needs fluctuate, miners act as consistent base load energy consumers. They help stabilize the grid, making new green energy projects financially feasible.”

According to Thiel, while Bitcoin mining incentivizes the production of renewable energy generation, Bitcoin miners in the U.S. are also drawn to renewable energy sources, as the excess energy they produce which is unable to be returned to the grid is some of the cheapest energy available in the U.S.

Thiel added that if this excess energy was not used by Bitcoin mining firms, it would not be able to be used by consumers and would otherwise be wasted.

Thiel noted that this mutually beneficial relationship between renewable energy producers and Bitcoin miners is contributing to an already ongoing shift towards more sustainable sources of electricity, pointing to the most recent survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC).

Based on the results of the survey, the BMC estimated that 58.9% of the electricity used in Bitcoin mining throughout the last quarter of 2022 was generated by renewable energy sources, a number that is increasing over time.

AI Eye: ‘Biggest ever’ leap in AI, cool new tools, AIs are the real DAOs

Thiel was also very scathing of the DAME tax, arguing that “it is a shot at a specific industry, not at a specific practice or fuel source,” adding:

“If the Biden Administration really wanted to reduce global emissions, it would target the ways electricity is generated – not arbitrarily target select industries that use it.”

He said that the proposal “is intended to run Bitcoin miners out of business” and “will both raise energy prices for consumers and reduce the feasibility of renewable energy development in the U.S.,” concluding:

""Either the administration is utterly misguided, or this proposed tax is nothing more than a move to hamper this industry for political reasons, because it is not in the interest of the people, the energy grid, or the environment.""

The proposal comes amid calls that a lack of regulatory clarity and access to banking services in the U.S. is killing its crypto industry, and if the DAME tax is approved by Congress it may just be one more nail in the coffin.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

At the Metaverse Entertainment Worlds (MEWS) conference in Monaco, Cointelegraph sat down with Stephen Castell to discuss how emerging technologies are creating new ethics, changing the game for banks and more.

Castell is an expert witness in class-action lawsuits in the United States, has a Ph.D. in mathematics, and has been recently involved in major lawsuits involving crypto giants, such as Voyager and Binance.

Cointelegraph editor-in-chief Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr in conversation with Dr. Stephen Castell at MEWS 2023.

The legal expert began the talk by highlighting trust as a foundational theme in the emerging tech space. He tied trust to the recent banking crisis in the U.S. and commented that this was also a “fundamental idea of a bank” at its conception.

However, banks now “basically run on a bad business model,” he said. He pointed out that although the crypto community has visions to revolutionize the financial system through technological innovation, there needs to be regulation.

“Just because it’s crypto is different, there still are laws to protect investors, which govern crypto investments as much as they do any other potential investment.”

When it comes to emerging technologies like AI, Castell predicts that banks will be at the “forefront” of the adoption of such technology. 

“The banks are going to try and do it for the benefit of themselves,” he said. “To be safe, to have safe money, to have good investments, not to lose, not to go bust, not to solve the conundrum of what they do on a bank run.”

Castell continued to point out that, aside from benefiting banks, the introduction of AI into humanity will cause the “democratization and commoditization of intelligence.”

“It means that any human on the planet, maybe even some animals, too, can be just as intelligent and as creative as the most intelligent and most creative person that there’s ever been.”

He suggested that humans will need to be “socialized” with AI and other emerging technologies like the metaverse in order for it to be useful. 

“It’s still going to do something for us — useful, valuable, exciting, productive. It’s got to do all of those things if it’s going to become generic.”

AI has had no scarcity in use cases since it skyrocketed in popularity among the general public in recent months. Lawmakers in the United Kingdom are looking at the technology to be used as a tool for economic growth. 

In the crypto space, exchanges are implementing AI-based chatbots to help educate users on everything from industry news to token prices and events.

“I really hope that all the new technologies that we’re talking about actually will create new ethics for this new human species that we are.”

Castell believes that what is being seen now in the emerging tech space is just the beginning of what he called the “cyborgization” of humans.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has created a furor recently with its possibility to revolutionize how people approach and solve different tasks and complex problems. From healthcare to finance, AI and its associated machine-learning models have demonstrated their potential to streamline intricate processes, enhance decision-making patterns and uncover valuable insights. 

However, despite the technology’s immense potential, a lingering “black box” problem has continued to present a significant challenge for its adoption, raising questions about the transparency and interpretability of these sophisticated systems.

In brief, the black box problem stems from the difficulty in understanding how AI systems and machine learning models process data and generate predictions or decisions. These models often rely on intricate algorithms that are not easily understandable to humans, leading to a lack of accountability and trust.

Therefore, as AI becomes increasingly integrated into various aspects of our lives, addressing this problem is crucial to ensuring this powerful technology’s responsible and ethical use.

The black box: An overview

The “black box” metaphor stems from the notion that AI systems and machine learning models operate in a manner concealed from human understanding, much like the contents of a sealed, opaque box. These systems are built upon complex mathematical models and high-dimensional data sets, which create intricate relationships and patterns that guide their decision-making processes. However, these inner workings are not readily accessible or understandable to humans.

In practical terms, the AI black box problem is the difficulty of deciphering the reasoning behind an AI system’s predictions or decisions. This issue is particularly prevalent in deep learning models like neural networks, where multiple layers of interconnected nodes process and transform data in a hierarchical manner. The intricacy of these models and the non-linear transformations they perform make it exceedingly challenging to trace the rationale behind their outputs.

Nikita Brudnov, CEO of BR Group — an AI-based marketing analytics dashboard — told Cointelegraph that the lack of transparency in how AI models arrive at certain decisions and predictions could be problematic in many contexts, such as medical diagnosis, financial decision-making and legal proceedings, significantly impacting the continued adoption of AI.

Magazine: Joe Lubin: The truth about ETH founders split and ‘Crypto Google’

“In recent years, much attention has been paid to the development of techniques for interpreting and explaining decisions made by AI models, such as generating feature importance scores, visualizing decision boundaries and identifying counterfactual hypothetical explanations,” he said, adding:

“However, these techniques are still in their infancy, and there is no guarantee that they will be effective in all cases.”

Brudnov further believes that with further decentralization, regulators may require decisions made by AI systems to be more transparent and accountable to ensure their ethical validity and overall fairness. He also suggested that consumers may hesitate to use AI-powered products and services if they do not understand how they work and their decision-making process.

James Wo, the founder of DFG — an investment firm that actively invests in AI-related technologies — believes that the black box issue won’t affect adoption for the foreseeable future. Per Wo, most users don’t necessarily care how existing AI models operate and are happy to simply derive utility from them, at least for now.

“In the mid-term, once the novelty of these platforms wears off, there will definitely be more skepticism about the black box methodology. Questions will also increase as AI use enters crypto and Web3, where there are financial stakes and consequences to consider,” he conceded.

Impact on trust and transparency

One domain where the absence of transparency can substantially impact the trust is AI-driven medical diagnostics. For example, AI models can analyze complex medical data in healthcare to generate diagnoses or treatment recommendations. However, when clinicians and patients cannot comprehend the rationale behind these suggestions, they might question the reliability and validity of these insights. This skepticism can further lead to hesitance in adopting AI solutions, potentially impeding advancements in patient care and personalized medicine.

In the financial realm, AI systems can be employed for credit scoring, fraud detection and risk assessment. However, the black box problem can create uncertainty regarding the fairness and accuracy of these credit scores or the reasoning behind fraud alerts, limiting the technology’s ability to digitize the industry.

The crypto industry also faces the repercussions of the black box problem. For example, digital assets and blockchain technology are rooted in decentralization, openness and verifiability. AI systems that lack transparency and interpretability stand to form a disconnect between user expectations and the reality of AI-driven solutions in this space.

Regulatory concerns

From a regulatory standpoint, the AI black box problem presents unique challenges. For starters, the opacity of AI processes can make it increasingly difficult for regulators to assess the compliance of these systems with existing rules and guidelines. Moreover, a lack of transparency can complicate the ability of regulators to develop new frameworks that can address the risks and challenges posed by AI applications.

Lawmakers may struggle to evaluate AI systems’ fairness, bias and data privacy practices, and their potential impact on consumer rights and market stability. Additionally, without a clear understanding of the decision-making processes of AI-driven systems, regulators may face difficulties in identifying potential vulnerabilities and ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place to mitigate risks.

One notable regulatory development regarding this technology has been the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act, which is moving closer to becoming part of the bloc’s statute book after reaching a provisional political agreement on April 27.

At its core, the AI Act aims to create a trustworthy and responsible environment for AI development within the EU. Lawmakers have adopted a classification system that categorizes different types of AI by risk: unacceptable, high, limited and minimal. This framework is designed to address various concerns related to the AI black box problem, including issues around transparency and accountability.

The inability to effectively monitor and regulate AI systems has already strained relationships between different industries and regulatory bodies.

Early last month, the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT was banned in Italy for 29 days, primarily due to privacy concerns raised by the country’s data protection agency for suspected violations of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). However, the platform was allowed to resume its services on April 29 after CEO Sam Altman announced that he and his team had taken specific steps to comply with the regulator’s demands, including the revelation of its data processing practices and implementation of its implementation of age-gating measures.

Inadequate regulation of AI systems could erode public trust in AI applications as users become increasingly concerned about inherent biases, inaccuracies and ethical implications.

Addressing the black box problem

To address the AI black box problem effectively, employing a combination of approaches that promote transparency, interpretability and accountability is essential. Two such complementary strategies are explainable AI (XAI) and open-source models.

XAI is an area of research dedicated to bridging the gap between the complexity of AI systems and the need for human interpretability. XAI focuses on developing techniques and algorithms that can provide human-understandable explanations for AI-driven decisions, offering insights into the reasoning behind these choices.

Methods often employed in XAI include surrogate models, feature importance analysis, sensitivity analysis, and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. Implementing XAI across industries can help stakeholders better understand AI-driven processes, enhancing trust in the technology and facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements.

In tandem with XAI, promoting the adoption of open-source AI models can be an effective strategy to address the black box problem. Open-source models grant full access to the algorithms and data that drive AI systems, enabling users and developers to scrutinize and understand the underlying processes.

This increased transparency can help build trust and foster collaboration among developers, researchers and users. Furthermore, the open-source approach can create more robust, accountable and effective AI systems.

The black box problem in the crypto space

The black box problem has significant ramifications for various aspects of the crypto space, including trading strategies, market predictions, security measures, tokenization and smart contracts.

In the realm of trading strategies and market predictions, AI-driven models are gaining popularity as investors seek to capitalize on algorithmic trading. However, the black box problem hinders users’ understanding of how these models function, making it challenging to assess their effectiveness and potential risks. Consequently, this opacity can also result in unwarranted trust in AI-driven investment decisions or make investors overly reliant on automated systems.

AI stands to play a crucial role in enhancing security measures within the blockchain ecosystem by detecting fraudulent transactions and suspicious activities. Nevertheless, the black box problem complicates the verification process for these AI-driven security solutions. The lack of transparency in decision-making may erode trust in security systems, raising concerns about their ability to safeguard user assets and information.

Tokenization and smart contracts — two vital components of the blockchain ecosystem — are also witnessing increased integration of AI. However, the black box problem can obscure the logic behind AI-generated tokens or smart contract execution.

As AI revolutionizes various industries, addressing the black box problem is becoming more pressing. By fostering collaboration between researchers, developers, policymakers and industry stakeholders, solutions can be developed to promote transparency, accountability and trust in AI systems. Thus, it will be interesting to see how this novel tech paradigm continues to evolve.

Despite Hong Kong steadily progressing with cryptocurrency adoption, mainland China has not changed its anti-crypto stance in terms of local regulations.

Some Chinese state-affiliated banks have increasingly opened bank accounts to serve crypto clients in Hong Kong. CPIC Investment Management — a China government-backed firm regulated as a Hong Kong entity — even launched two cryptocurrency funds in April.

All these developments don’t mean that China has softened or will soften its approach to regulating Bitcoin

 anytime soon, according to CPIC Investment Management CEO Chenggang Zhou.

“The Hong Kong government tries very hard to promote Web3 and crypto, but it doesn’t imply any changes in mainland regulatory regulations or the Chinese government’s attitude toward crypto,” Zhou said in an interview with Cointelegraph on May 5.

Zhou emphasized that despite China government’s backing, CPIC Investment Management operates as a Hong Kong entity regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission.

“Hong Kong regulations allow us to invest in different markets or asset classes or products like cryptocurrencies, so we’re not breaching any regulations or laws,” the CEO said. He added:

“We got involved in crypto because Hong Kong regulations allow us to do that. But it’s in no way any indication of the China government’s attitude or policy, or change of policy.”

China has maintained its anti-crypto stance for a long time, even before banning crypto entirely in September 2021, Zhou noted. He said that he doesn’t expect the local government to change its crypto policies in the foreseeable future.

The CEO isn’t alone in thinking that China remains and will remain anti-crypto while trying to beef up Chinese bank deposits with crypto accounts.

“Given that the Chinese government is coming down hard on the financial sector, it is hard to imagine that China is loosening its control over the ability for Chinese nationals to use crypto,” Lesperance & Associates founder David Lesperance told Cointelegraph.

According to Lesperance, China wants to increase its foreign currency deposits, whether that is fiat to purchase crypto or crypto itself. “They are bifurcating the markets to shut out domestic Chinese customers but attracting foreign customers,” he noted.

The lawyer also noted that the crypto market in mainland China is “still effectively shut down.” That raises enforcement concerns about Chinese clients getting a chance to use Hong Kong exchanges to get money out of China. “Certainly, the authorities will try to stop this leakage,” Lesperance noted.

CPIC’s Zhou also mentioned that crypto exchanges in Hong Kong have strict Know Your Customer policies, which aim to restrict mainland Chinese investors on their platforms.

“I don’t expect any licensed crypto exchanges in Hong Kong to accept onshore mainland citizens to trade in the exchanges,” Zhou stated.

Memecoins have been part and parcel of the cryptocurrency space since the inception of Dogecoin back in 2013, with fortunes made and ruined in equal measure. But a new token on the block caused a stir in recent weeks, as Pepe (PEPE) grabs a chunk of the memecoin market share from plucky investors.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, PEPE saw a 2,000% boom in value following its launch in late April 2023. The token’s rally is primarily attributed to zealous memecoin hype, with the project widely shared on Twitter over the past month.

The Pepe website itself is brandished with a closing disclaimer, labeling PEPE as “a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return.“ The project also stipulates that it has no formal team or roadmap and that the token is “completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.“

Data analytics firm Nansen provided insightful data and key takeaways following the rise of PEPE’s market capitalization. Research analyst Xin Yi estimated that the total memecoin market value is around $20 billion, with the top five tokens, Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

, Shiba Inu 

SHIB

, PEPE, Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) and Floki (FLOKI), accounting for over $18 billion of the value.

Data provided from Nansen Query shows the massive spike in token value and market capitalization of PEPE in relation to the other top five memecoins. Yi also notes that the infographic does not paint a complete picture, given that the data for PEPE reflects its listing on CoinGecko, which came a couple of weeks after its inception.

Yi told Cointelegraph that the social aspect of memecoins remains a significant driver of investor sentiment and action, highlighting the likes of Elon Musk’s infamous Dogecoin touts and rampant Twitter bots driving memecoin hashtags to relevance on Twitter:

“Since memecoins have no intrinsic value, it relies on catalysts such as social relevance and also events like 4/20, which is known as DOGE day, can affect the prices of the token as well.”

As previously explored, Nansen provides data analytics and insights into “smart money” cryptocurrency traders and holders by labeling wallets and tracking trades. The rise of PEPE has also attracted a significant number of smart money holders, as per on-chain data highlighted by Yi. She added that a few thousand traders might benefit from the surge in the value of memecoins, which is a gamble given that many other memecoins are pump-and-dump or rug-pull schemes:

“Nonetheless, gains on one good coin can easily surpass the cost of the other ‘failed’ coins, which is probably why these memecoins remain attractive for most traders to ape into. Hence, it really depends on the investor’s risk appetite.”

Nevertheless, Yi also pointed out that the inherent risk of memecoins often leads to liquidity crunches, where major tokenholders dump their holdings, leaving smaller investors reeling from losses.

The frog-themed memecoin Pepe (PEPE) surged over 85% in the last 24 hours to surpass a $1 billion market cap three weeks after its launch on April 14, 2023.

Ironically, the core value proposition of PEPE is that there isn’t one. The official website for the cryptocurrency features a disclaimer that describes investment in the token in the following manner:

“$PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. the coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.”

Currently, Pepe seems to be treading a similar path to its more well-known memecoin counterparts Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 and Shiba Inu 

SHIB

$0.000009

.

In 2021, DOGE surged by over 23,000%, mainly due to the vocal support for the token espoused by billionaire Elon Musk on Twitter.

Similarly, SHIB surged by over 1,250% during the 2021 crypto bull market after using Dogecoin as a springboard for its popularity.

Due to the lack of any underlying fundamentals, investment in memecoins is high risk, and they are notorious for extreme volatility and major swings in value. A closer look at some of the on-chain activity from Pepe insiders points to some concerning trades.

According to data from the blockchain analytics service Lookonchain, five addresses allegedly linked to the Pepe team made a $1.23 million profit in a thin liquid market. They purchased 8.87 trillion PEPE at a low price and sold over 90% of their holdings on Uniswap for a gain.

It’s worth noting that some of the top PEPE holders are centralized exchanges. However, according to data tracked by analyst “008.eth,”non-exchange PEPE whales have reduced positions recently, hinting at profit-taking that coincided with a price correction on May 3.

Zimbabwe’s central bank has set a price for its gold-backed digital tokens. The country is planning to sell its gold-backed digital currency to investors starting May 8. The tokens will be sold at a minimum price of $10 for individuals and $5,000 for corporations and other entities.

According to a statement released by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe on May 4, the gold-backed digital currency tokens will be sold in U.S. dollars and local currency. However, the local currency price will have a 20% margin above the willing-buyer willing-seller interbank mid-rate. Interested investors can participate in the offer from May 8, which will close two days later.

The willing-buyer willing-seller interbank mid-rate is the exchange rate at which banks are willing to buy and sell currencies to each other. It is considered the “midpoint” between the buying and selling rates determined by prevailing market conditions such as supply and demand. This rate is used as a benchmark for many financial transactions, and is often used as a reference rate for exchange rates quoted by banks and financial institutions.

The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe announced its plans to introduce a gold-backed digital currency to serve as legal tender in the country on April 28.

The introduction of digital tokens is the latest move by the southern African nation to support its own local currency, which has weakened 37% against the U.S. dollar on the official market this year, according to Bloomberg.

The Monetary Policy Committee approved the plan in March, eight months after Zimbabwe introduced gold coins as a store of value to help support the local unit.

According to a Bloomberg report, Zimbabwe’s currency — the Zimbabwean dollar — is quoted at 1,001 against the U.S. dollar, but is commonly exchanged at 1,750 on the streets of Harare, the capital city of the country.

Zimbabwe has been battling currency instability and high inflation rates for over ten years. After a period of hyperinflation, the country adopted the U.S. dollar in 2009. In an attempt to revive the struggling economy, the Zimbabwean dollar was reintroduced in 2019. However, in 2022, the government reverted back to using the U.S. dollar to control rising prices.

Nigeria introduced its own digital currency — the eNaira — in 2021, becoming the first African nation to do so.

Google engineer concerned about open-source AI gaining edge

A leaked document from a senior software engineer sounds the alarm about Google’s artificial intelligence development.

According to a critique written by a senior software engineer at Google, the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) development is threatened by the open-source community. The engineer contends that independent researchers in open-source technology are making swift and unforeseen strides in AI technology. 

In early April, software engineer Luke Sernau published a document on an internal system. The document was subsequently shared extensively among Google employees over the next few weeks. A source, who requested anonymity as they were not permitted to discuss internal company affairs, claimed that the document had been circulated thousands of times. On Thursday, the document was published by consulting firm SemiAnalysis and began to circulate in Silicon Valley.

According to Sernau’s assessment, Google’s competition with OpenAI had diverted attention from the swift progress in open-source technology. In his document, Sernau wrote that Google had focused excessively on keeping tabs on OpenAI’s progress. While both companies struggled to outperform each other, open-source technology had quietly advanced, surpassing Google and OpenAI in the AI race.

Google is known for investing in futuristic technologies, and its labs have played a significant role in developing the current AI-powered chatbots. However, OpenAI has emerged as a frontrunner in generative AI, which involves software that can create its own images, text and videos. OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022 and quickly gained popularity. Its sudden success has left Google sprinting to catch up in a key technology subfield.

However, Sernau argued that open-source communities pose a real threat to Google, as engineers are developing models rivaling the quality of those at Big Tech companies at a faster pace and lower cost. According to him, these models are more customizable, faster and more useful than Google’s own models. He also worried that clients might not be willing to pay for high-quality technology when it is available for free in open-source communities.

The vice president of the United States and President Joe Biden’s top advisers have held a meeting with several AI industry CEOs to discuss “concerns about the risks associated with AI.”

On May 4, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was joined by nine top Biden administration advisers in science, national security, policy and economics, meeting with the CEOs of OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and AI startup Anthropic.

Notably, tech giant Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting.

Before the meeting, the White House released a flurry of AI-related announcements regarding the funding of AI research facilities, government AI policy and AI systems evaluation.

The meeting focused on the transparency of AI systems, the importance of evaluating and validating the safety of AI and ensuring AI is secured from malicious actors, according to the announcement.

Reportedly, the government and the tech CEOs agreed “more work is needed to develop and ensure appropriate safeguards and protections” for AI.

The CEOs committed to engaging with the White House to ensure Americans can “benefit from AI innovation.” No specific details were shared on what safeguards were needed or what the engagement with the government exactly entails.

Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting despite Meta working on AI for years. A White House official told CNN, “It was focused on companies currently leading in the space.”

The Biden administration also highlighted its work to address national security concerns posed by AI, specifically mentioning cybersecurity and biosecurity, without going into specifics.

It said these efforts would ensure AI firms “have access to best practices” to protect AI networks from state cybersecurity experts from the “national security community.”

White House banks big on AI

On the same day, the Biden Administration announced it would put aside $140 million to launch seven new national AI research institutes, bringing the total to 25 across the country.

“These Institutes bolster America’s AI [research and development] infrastructure,” the White House said. It added the institutes would “drive breakthroughs” in areas such as “climate, agriculture, energy, public health, education, and cybersecurity.”

In a separate announcement, the government said AI development firms including Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Hugging Face and Stability AI will also participate in publicly evaluating AI systems on a platform from AI training firm Scale AI at the hacker convention DEFCON in August.

Finally, the White House said it would release a draft policy on how the U.S. government will use AI, which will be will be made available for public comment this summer.

Policies around the development, use and procurement of AI by federal departments and agencies will be drafted. It said the policies would be a model for state and local governments in their own procurement and use of AI.

Anyone who has dealt with trading in traditional finance is likely to be aware of profit and loss (PnL). But is PnL in the cryptocurrency world the same? The ability to comprehend terms like mark-to-market (MTM), realized PnL and unrealized PnL will help develop a better understanding of the cryptocurrency a person holds.

Without a well-defined process to get insight into profit or loss, cryptocurrency trading may be overwhelming, and traders may struggle with what they are doing. PnL reflects the change in the value of a trader’s positions over a specific period. 

To gain a clearer understanding, let's examine it in the context of cryptocurrency trading.

Understanding the basics of PnL

PnL in crypto refers to the calculation of the profit or loss made on a cryptocurrency investment or trading position. It is a metric used to evaluate the financial performance of a trader or investor in the crypto market.

To begin, here are some key terms in PnL terminology:

MTM

MTM refers to the process of valuing an asset or financial instrument based on its current market price or fair value. For example, in the context of crypto trading, if an investor holds a certain amount of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,602

, the value of that Bitcoin will fluctuate based on the current market price.

The general formula for calculating PnL is:

Suppose the MTM price for Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 today is $1,970, while the MTM price yesterday was $1,950. In this case, the PnL is $20. It indicates a profit of $20. On the contrary, if the MTM price of ETH was $1,980 yesterday, it indicates a loss of $10.

Future value

Future value indicates the value of a digital coin at a future point in time.

For example, if a trader stakes Tron 

TRX

$0.0689

 worth $1,000 with a 4% yearly reward, how much will the person get back after a year? The answer is $1,040. At the time of staking, the present value will be $1,000, while the future value will be $1,040.

There will be a present value at the point when the trader stakes, but if the person considers the future as a whole, there could be countless future values.

There is a different way to use future value as well. Traders could ask how much to stake to get $1,040 in a year. If they know the present and future values, they could calculate the discount factor. The formula for calculating the discount factor is:

For the example given above, the discount factor will be:

Realized PnL

Realized PnL is calculated after traders have closed their position (sold the cryptocurrency they hold). Only the executed price of the orders is taken into account in realized PnL, and it has no direct relation to the mark price.

The mark price is the price at which a derivatives contract is valued based on the current market price of the underlying asset rather than the price at which the contract is being traded.

The formula for realized PnL is:

An example will help understand how to calculate realized PnL. If the entry price for buying X number of Polkadot 

DOT

$5.33

 is $70 and the exit price is $105, the PnL for the period is $35, which refers to a profit of $35. However, if the closing price of the trade was $55, the PnL will be $15, but it will reflect a loss.

Unrealized PnL

Unrealized PnL refers to the profit or loss that is currently held in open positions but has not yet been realized through closing the position. The formula for determining unrealized PnL is:

Donald has purchased ETH contracts with an average entry price of $1,900. The mark price of ETH is currently $1,600. The unrealized PnL for Donald is the difference between the average entry price and the mark price.

Unrealized PnL = $1,900 - $1,600 = $300

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

How to do PnL calculation

To determine PnL in cryptocurrency, a trader needs to find the difference between the initial cost of acquiring a digital coin and the current market value of the same coin. Various methods to calculate PnL in cryptocurrency are as follows:

First-in, first-out (FIFO) method

The FIFO method requires the seller to use the price of the asset from when it was first bought. Here is the process to calculate PnL using the FIFO method:

1) To settle on the initial cost of the cryptocurrency, multiply the purchase price per unit by the number of units sold.

2) To determine the current market value of the asset disposed of, multiply the current market price per unit by the number of units sold.

3) To find the PnL, deduct the initial cost from the current market value.

Suppose Bob first bought 1 ETH at $1,100 and a few days later bought 1 ETH at $800. A year later, he sold 1 ETH at $1,200. As he had first bought ETH at $1,100, this price will be considered the initial cost. Applying the FIFO method, Bob could calculate PnL as follows:

Bob's initial cost = (1 ETH x $1,100) = $1,100

Current market value = (1 ETH x $1,200) = $1,200

PnL = $1,200 - $1,100 = $100 (profit)

Last-in, first-out (LIFO) method

The LIFO method requires the seller to use the most recent purchase price of an asset in the calculation. The other aspects are just like the FIFO method. Here is the PnL using the LIFO method using the same example as above:

Bob’s initial cost = (1 ETH x $800) = $800

Current market value = (1 ETH x $1,200) = $1,200

PnL = $1,200 - $800 = $400 (profit)

Weighted average cost method

The weighted average cost method requires traders to determine the average cost of all units of a digital currency in their portfolio to arrive at the initial cost. Here are the steps to calculate PnL using this method:

1) Determine the total cost of all units of the cryptocurrency. Multiply the purchase price per unit for each transaction by the number of units of the asset and add the numbers.

2) To arrive at the weighted average cost per unit of the digital coin, divide the total cost of all units by the number of units.

3) Find the current market value of the cryptocurrency sold. Multiply the current market price per unit by the number of units sold.

4) To determine PnL, subtract the average cost per unit from the current market value.

Suppose Alice bought 1 BTC at $1,500 and a few days later bought 1 BTC at $2,000. She later sold 1 BTC at $2,400. Here is the PnL using the weighted average cost method:

Total cost = (1 BTC x $1,500) + (1 BTC x $2,000) = $3,500

Weighted average cost = $3,500 / 2 BTC = $1,750

Current market value = (1 BTC x $2,400) = $2,400

PnL = $2,400 - $1,750 = $650 (profit)

Profits/losses from opening and closing positions

Analyzing open and closed positions at regular intervals is an efficient way to monitor performance. An initial purchase a person makes in the market is an open position, while selling the cryptocurrency is termed closing the position. If a trader buys 10 DOT, it is an open position. When the trader sells those DOT, the position gets closed.

For example, if a trader bought 10 DOT for $70 and sold them for $100, the person’s PnL would be $30 ($100 - $70). Regular analysis of trades in line with open and closed positions helps a person trade in an organized manner.

Year-to-date (YTD) calculation

YTD is a way to measure the performance of investments made in cryptocurrency from the start of the year to the current date. Investors who regularly buy and hold cryptocurrencies for years can know their unrealized profits with a YTD calculation. The trader just needs to calculate the value of the portfolio at the beginning and end of a year and compare these values. This could be a calendar year or fiscal year, depending on the person’s preference or requirements.

Suppose someone holds $1,000 worth of Cardano 

ADA

$0.363

 on Jan. 1, 2022 and $1,600 of ADA on Jan. 1, 2023. In this case, $600 is the unrealized profit. Unrealized profit denotes returns that haven’t yet been converted into cash or cash equivalents such as term deposits.

Transaction-based calculation

A transaction-based calculation requires a person to calculate the PnL for each specific transaction. For instance, if a person bought 1 ETH for $1,000 and sold it for $1,500, the PnL for the transaction would be $500 profit ($1,500 - $1,000). If the number of transactions is small and a trader needs to calculate PnL for these transactions separately, a transaction-based calculation is an ideal method.

Percentage profit

The percentage profit method reflects the PnL as a percentage of the initial cost. An example will help understand better. Suppose a trader buys 1 Binance Coin 

BNB

$313

 for $300 and sells it for $390. In this case, the person’s PnL would be $90 profit ($390 - $300). To arrive at the percentage profit, the trader needs to divide the PnL by the purchase price and multiply the amount by 100 (($90 / $300) x 100). This amounts to 30%.

However, please note that these are simplified examples that do not factor in variables such as taxes, trading fees paid to the platform, market volatility, etc. In real-life situations, a trader will need to take into account the specific context when calculating PnL.

How to calculate PnL of perpetual contracts

Perpetual contracts are a type of futures contract with no fixed settlement time or expiration date. Traders can hold their long or short positions indefinitely, provided they have sufficient maintenance margin, which is the minimal amount of collateral needed for maintaining open trading positions.

When traders calculate the PnL of perpetual contracts in cryptocurrencies, they need to calculate both realized and unrealized PnL and then add them to determine the total PnL.

Here are the steps to measure PnL of perpetual contracts:

Again, this is a simplified way to explain the concept of calculating PnL for crypto perpetual contracts. When calculating total PnL in real life, a trader needs to take into account factors like trading fees and funding rates.

PnL calculations and associated tools

Understanding crypto PnL helps people know if their cryptocurrency portfolio is in profit or in loss. Gaining an insight into key parameters like cost basis, quantity, price of each trade and profitability of the portfolio helps traders assess the efficiency of their strategies and make necessary adjustments. Precise knowledge of the funds they have made or lost on a particular trade influences their upcoming trading decisions for the better.

Apart from PnL calculations, there are tools like specialized spreadsheets and automated trading bots that could help traders analyze their performances and zero in on profitable trading opportunities, regardless of their experience.

The vice president of the United States and President Joe Biden’s top advisers have held a meeting with several AI industry CEOs to discuss “concerns about the risks associated with AI.”

On May 4, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was joined by nine top Biden administration advisers in science, national security, policy and economics, meeting with the CEOs of OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and AI startup Anthropic.

Notably, tech giant Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting.

Before the meeting, the White House released a flurry of AI-related announcements regarding the funding of AI research facilities, government AI policy and AI systems evaluation.

The meeting focused on the transparency of AI systems, the importance of evaluating and validating the safety of AI and ensuring AI is secured from malicious actors, according to the announcement.

Reportedly, the government and the tech CEOs agreed “more work is needed to develop and ensure appropriate safeguards and protections” for AI.

The CEOs committed to engaging with the White House to ensure Americans can “benefit from AI innovation.” No specific details were shared on what safeguards were needed or what the engagement with the government exactly entails.

Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting despite Meta working on AI for years. A White House official told CNN, “It was focused on companies currently leading in the space.”

The Biden administration also highlighted its work to address national security concerns posed by AI, specifically mentioning cybersecurity and biosecurity, without going into specifics.

It said these efforts would ensure AI firms “have access to best practices” to protect AI networks from state cybersecurity experts from the “national security community.”

White House banks big on AI

On the same day, the Biden Administration announced it would put aside $140 million to launch seven new national AI research institutes, bringing the total to 25 across the country.

“These Institutes bolster America’s AI [research and development] infrastructure,” the White House said. It added the institutes would “drive breakthroughs” in areas such as “climate, agriculture, energy, public health, education, and cybersecurity.”

In a separate announcement, the government said AI development firms including Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Hugging Face and Stability AI will also participate in publicly evaluating AI systems on a platform from AI training firm Scale AI at the hacker convention DEFCON in August.

Finally, the White House said it would release a draft policy on how the U.S. government will use AI, which will be will be made available for public comment this summer.

Policies around the development, use and procurement of AI by federal departments and agencies will be drafted. It said the policies would be a model for state and local governments in their own procurement and use of AI.

Coinbase remains ‘100% committed’ to US market — Armstrong

Coinbase‘s CEO has a lot of faith that Congress will make a “clear rule book” for crypto firms to follow. But the Securities and Exchange Commission? Not so much.

United States-founded cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has no plans to move its operations out of the U.S., CEO Brian Armstrong told investors in an Q1 earnings call.

On May 5, Armstrong assured shareholders that the firm is “100% committed” to the U.S. market over the long term despite regulatory uncertainty in the U.S.

“So let me be clear, we’re 100% committed to the U.S. I founded this company in the United States because I saw that rule of law prevails here. That’s really important, and I’m actually really optimistic on the U.S. getting this right.”

The optimism alluded to by Armstrong comes from his confidence in Congress soon passing a clear set of rules for crypto firms to follow:

“When I go visit DC, there is strong bipartisan support for Congress to come in and create new legislation that would create a clear rule book in the U.S. and I think it's really important for America to get this right.”

However, Armstrong’s comments weren’t entirely optimistic.

The CEO is concerned about the unpredictable enforcement action of the Securities Exchange Commission, which comes in light of the firm being served with a Wells notice by the securities regulator in late March:

“Despite our ongoing engagement with the commission, they have not been as clear about what their specific concerns are with Coinbase as we might like, and so I have to refrain from speculating too much.”

“It's especially difficult to predict the timeline of any potential SEC litigation that we might face,” Armstrong added.

The troubles led Coinbase to file an action in a U.S. federal court seeking to compel the SEC to answer a petition that has been pending since July.

The back and forth comes as Coinbase launched Coinbase International Exchange (CIE) on May 2, which prompted many pundits to believe that Coinbase was looking for an escape route from the U.S.

The exchange is open to customers in 30 countries worldwide, including Singapore, Hong Kong, El Salvador, Philippines, Thailand and Bermuda — where CIE is now licensed from.

Armstrong said the European Union is “in front” in terms of regulatory progress with its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation set to enter into effect in mid-2024 or early 2025:

“They've adopted comprehensive crypto legislation called MiCA, creates a single clear rule book for the entire region. It's pretty powerful.”

“I just got back from a trip from the U.K. and D.C. Both of those have draft bills in the works that are working on things like around stablecoins and market structure — Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil; all are essentially following in this direction,” Armstrong added.

The CEO’s remarks come as Coinbase managed to increase its first-quarter revenue by 22% while slashing its net income loss by over $475 million, to $79 million.

Cash App Bitcoin revenue tops $2B in the first quarter

Block’s Q1 earnings report reveals a 25% year-on-year increase in Bitcoin revenue from the fintech firm’s flagship product, Cash App.

Fintech firm Block, owned by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, has reported a staggering $2.16 billion in Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,602

 revenue on its bellwether product Cash App in Q1.

According to a shareholder letter announcing its Q1 2023 earnings, Block (NYSE:SQ) reported that its Bitcoin revenue — which counts BTC revenue as total sales of the cryptocurrency to customers — was up 18% from $1.83 billion in Q4 and 25% from Q1 2022.

Our Q1 earnings are now available. $SQ https://t.co/oGcnRuzFb3

— Block Investor Relations (@BlockIR) May 4, 2023

Cash App’s total profits reached over $931 million in the first quarter of 2023, marking a 49% increase year-over-year. Notably, Cash App’s profit paled compared to the company’s gross profit, which came in at $1.71 billion. Block also owns the popular business payment service Square, which reported a slight (3.8%) decline in profits from the fourth quarter of 2022.

According to the shareholder letter, the multi-billion-dollar Bitcoin revenues were driven by “an increase in the quantity of Bitcoin sold to customers,” and were “partially offset” by a decrease in the market price of Bitcoin, compared to the same timeframe in 2022.

The fintech firm also reported an earning per share of 40 cents, beating analyst expectations of 35 cents per share by 14%, with its first-quarter revenue rising 26% year-on-year.

Speaking to investors in the earnings conference call, Block CEO Jack Dorsey identified both artificial intelligence and “open protocols” as technologies that would aid the company in proactively responding to the “significant shifts” in the global financial system He cited continued United States bank failures and de-dollarization as the primary culprits.

The equities market took kindly to Block’s earnings filings. The fintech firm’s share price briefly surged 5% to $63.50 in after-hours trading, before settling down to a 2.5% gain at the time of publication.

This uptick marked the first instance of relief from a steady decline in Block’s share price, which suffered a significant 25% hit following the release of a scathing report penned by famed short sellers Hindenburg Research.

On March 23, Hindenburg slammed Block for “systematically taking advantage of the demographics it claims to be helping,” and declared that Block’s success with Cash App only hinged on a “willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government.”

“Hindenburg is known for these types of attacks, which are designed solely to allow short sellers to profit from a declined stock price,” wrote Block in response to Hindenburg’s allegations. “We have reviewed the full report in the context of our own data and believe it’s designed to deceive and confuse investors.”

Talking about nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in the music industry usually means protecting artists’ copyrights and diversifying their revenue streams, preserving artworks on the blockchain, musicians collaborating with brands and artists, printing event tickets, giving exclusive bonuses to fans in this unique digital format or engaging with a community. So, why not do what the sports industry has done (and quite successfully so) with the NFT memorabilia format?

The sports memorabilia market reached $2.6 billion in 2022 and is expected to hit $227.2 billion in 10 years. The collectibles include sports trading cards, video clips of popular moments in the history of sports, autographs, accessories, and many other things that can be in both physical and digital formats. The same can be said for music memorabilia with rare vintage photos that already exist, sometimes only in unknown archives that are hard to access.

Unique classic rock history moments

This was the case with Legends of Rock, which was acquired by Globe Entertainment and Media back in 2020. The collection, which had been owned by British photo agencies and archives for decades, was then shipped to Las Vegas. Packed in standard postal containers, it looked unlikely to contain anything of high value or importance.

It was a total surprise for Klaus Moeller, CEO of Globe Entertainment and Media, to find some 8 million vintage, never-before-seen photos of the biggest rock stars — Queen, Deep Purple, Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Frank Zappa, The Police, Bruce Springsteen, Nirvana, The Who and many more. The pictures were taken on stage and during other official moments, but also backstage in a more relaxed atmosphere. The photos were made between the 1960s and the early 1980s, with some artists already in the spotlight and others just beginning their prolific careers. “It’s never-ending. Every day we’re finding the craziest stuff,” said Moeller about the archive.

To make the collection accessible worldwide, Globe Entertainment and Media partnered with MADworld, an innovative Web3 and digital asset ecosystem backed by Animoca Brands.

Moeller said:

“We could not have found a better partner than MADworld to introduce these unique, pivotal moments from music history to a new generation of fans. This collaboration is helping us breathe new life to these legends of music’s past by onboarding them onto Web3.”

Along with the physical slides, a professional-quality, high-resolution digital image of the original slides is provided to the buyer as a digital Certificate of Authenticity (COA) NFT. This helps prove ownership and guarantees authenticity. In addition, in the event of a future secondary sale, it allows the buyer to conveniently and securely transfer ownership.

Phillip Tran, chief marketing officer of MADworld, said:

“We are thrilled to be part of this exciting project. A global audience of music lovers, collectors and investors will now be able to use a secure, digital COA to verify each slide’s provenance through blockchain technology to simplify the authentication process and protect collectors from forgeries.”

How to attract and retain top Web3 talents — Intropia Report

A new report takes a deep dive into the characteristics and expectations of the Web3 talent pool.

One of the most critical issues in the Web3 space that needs to be resolved as soon as possible is the blockchain trilemma in addressing decentralization, security, and scalability. Only then can this industry achieve mainstream adoption.

To solve this trilemma, the industry needs talent. However, attracting and retaining top professionals is the biggest pain point and bottleneck for every Web3 startup and DAO project. To keep the innovation engine humming, the Web3 industry needs to take a closer look at the available gallant tools to get professionals on board.

The Web3 talent pool offers a diverse range of expertise with a focus on multitasking and remote working, a new study revealed. The research, titled “Web3 Talent Survey,” is conducted by Intropia — a community-driven Web3 talent ecosystem. To understand and explore the attitudes and preferences of professionals looking into the Web3 space, Intropia surveyed over 6,000 respondents during the second half of 2022.

According to the research, a typical Web3 contributor — a term Intropia uses to broadly define talent working in the Web3 space — is between 25 and 44 years old and has been working professionally for more than five years. Fitting to the decentralized nature of Web3, community-related skills top the list as the most common primary skill set for Web3 contributors (16%). This is followed by skills focused on research (10%), engineering (9%) and product (7%).

Freelancers and part-time contributors lead the way when it comes to defining roles in the Web3 ecosystem, according to the report. One-fifth of respondents have full-time roles in decentralized anonymous organizations (DAOs), while 15% act as founding members in a DAO.

The ever-expanding universe of crypto and Web3 requires a knack for learning in order to keep up with the innovations and new trends introduced to the space on an almost monthly basis. So, it’s not surprising that the vast majority of Web3 contributors have a higher education and spend 8 to 32 hours each week on self-education. Those who learn also want to educate their network by teaching and mentoring others, the report emphasizes. Web3 professionals read articles and papers, attend courses or simply watch in-depth videos on YouTube to stay ahead of the curve.

What are professionals looking for in Web3?

The decentralized structure of the Web3 space is again reflected in the fact that the majority of respondents work on more than one project. More than 80% of respondents in the Intropia survey are working on multiple projects at once, which has become an industry standard. This also translates to the average weekly work hours of Web3 contributors. The report states that every third respondent works more than 32 hours per week.

When it comes to the types of projects, Web3 professionals are looking for opportunities in layer-1 networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains, layer-2 solutions like Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism, and decentralized apps (DApps).

“Web3 is like a club, with smart, like-minded individuals who are working toward a common goal,” the report summarizes, noting that more than half of the respondents (over 57%) rated their enjoyment of working in the Web3 space at 10 out of 10. The main concerns that stood out were scam projects, the fear of missing out (FOMO), and the slow rate of adoption.

The report urges projects seeking to hire Web3 professionals to embrace the diversity of the ecosystem. Because word-of-mouth is strong in the Web3 space, the top talent primarily uses referrals as a way to find their next gig. With a deeper understanding of the available talent pool, the industry will move forward with the next wave of innovation.

Final thoughts

The Web3 space is a thriving ecosystem that is continuously evolving. With its decentralized structure, Web3 professionals are creating innovative solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems. The industry's growth and popularity are reflected in the increasing number of projects, the hours worked by contributors, and the overall satisfaction of working in the space.

As the industry continues to expand, it is essential to address the concerns of Web3 professionals, such as scam projects and the slow rate of adoption. By taking a proactive approach to these issues, the industry can ensure that talented individuals remain engaged and motivated to work in the Web3 space. It is also crucial for projects seeking to hire Web3 professionals to foster an inclusive and diverse working culture that values collaboration and innovation. With these steps, the Web3 space can continue to grow and push the boundaries of what is possible.

So, it’s not surprising that the vast majority of Web3 contributors have a higher education and spend 8 to 32 hours each week on self-education. Those who learn also want to educate their network by teaching and mentoring others, the report emphasizes. Web3 professionals read articles and papers, attend courses or simply watch in-depth videos on YouTube to stay ahead of the curve.

What are professionals looking for in Web3?

The decentralized structure of the Web3 space is again reflected in the fact that the majority of respondents work on more than one project. More than 80% of respondents in the Intropia survey are working on multiple projects at once, which has become an industry standard. This also translates to the average weekly work hours of Web3 contributors. The report states that every third respondent works more than 32 hours per week.

When it comes to the types of projects, Web3 professionals are looking for opportunities in layer-1 networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains, layer-2 solutions like Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism, and decentralized apps (DApps).

“Web3 is like a club, with smart, like-minded individuals who are working toward a common goal,” the report summarizes, noting that more than half of the respondents (over 57%) rated their enjoyment of working in the Web3 space at 10 out of 10. The main concerns that stood out were scam projects, the fear of missing out (FOMO), and the slow rate of adoption.

The report urges projects seeking to hire Web3 professionals to embrace the diversity of the ecosystem. Because word-of-mouth is strong in the Web3 space, the top talent primarily uses referrals as a way to find their next gig. With a deeper understanding of the available talent pool, the industry will move forward with the next wave of innovation.

Final thoughts

The Web3 space is a thriving ecosystem that is continuously evolving. With its decentralized structure, Web3 professionals are creating innovative solutions for some of the world's most pressing problems. The industry's growth and popularity are reflected in the increasing number of projects, the hours worked by contributors, and the overall satisfaction of working in the space.

As the industry continues to expand, it is essential to address the concerns of Web3 professionals, such as scam projects and the slow rate of adoption. By taking a proactive approach to these issues, the industry can ensure that talented individuals remain engaged and motivated to work in the Web3 space. It is also crucial for projects seeking to hire Web3 professionals to foster an inclusive and diverse working culture that values collaboration and innovation. With these steps, the Web3 space can continue to grow and push the boundaries of what is possible.

Being stuck at home for almost two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world are eager to experience new cities, countries and cultures. The flexibility of working from home now allows travelers to plan around a less home-bound lifestyle. However, age-old problems, including delayed or canceled transportation, lost luggage and check-in mixups, continue to trouble the travel industry, which is expected to tap $850 billion in revenue by the end of 2023.

People rightly have high expectations for their travel experience, including low cost, better security, transparency and personalisation. These demands can be met with the help of peer-to-peer (P2P) connections, decentralized networks, fast transactions and interoperable systems that enable seamless data exchange.

That's why the travel industry needs blockchain solutions. The transparent, scalable and secure nature of blockchain technology can reduce costs, increase efficiency and foster collaboration to provide a more streamlined and personalised experience for travellers.

However, current blockchain networks fail to meet the needs of the highly-specialized nature of the travel industry, which works with fragmented processes across multiple stakeholders and where trust and regulatory compliance are crucial. A uniquely-designed blockchain is needed today to act as a layer 1 infrastructure to address the specific requirements of the travel industry.

Industry pioneers joined forces for efficiency

Seeing how blockchain can improve the current travel experience for all parties, industry pioneers, stakeholders and Web3 professionals come together to launch an inclusive blockchain ecosystem named Camino Network to pave the way for innovation in the multi-billion dollar industry. Supported by the travel giants like TUI, Lufthansa, Miles & More and Eurowings, Camino Network lays the groundwork for an entire ecosystem of Web3 travel apps and services.

Built on Avalanche’s technical base, Camino’s blockchain is tailored specifically for the travel ecosystem. The project leverages the next-generation capabilities of this technology to bring efficiency, security and innovation to the travel industry with the aim to provide better, more personalized experiences for travelers around the world.

Cutting down transaction costs by using blockchain helps with reducing fees for both businesses and users. A number of key players from the travel industry announced their backing for the Camino Network, with over 80 of them directly supporting the infrastructure by acting as initial validators of the blockchain.

NFTs and digital wallets for personalized travel experience

Despite being an essential need for travelers, updating hotel and accommodation info needs constant effort with legacy infrastructures. The information flow is bound by multiple bilateral contracts and interfaces, commonly resulting in outdated info for guests. Camino uses blockchain for more streamlined data management across all parties with nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

While NFTs are mainly known as digital collectibles in the Web3 space, the travel industry presents immense potential to go beyond one use case and introduce actual utility. Similarly, the travel industry can benefit from the flexibility and reliability of NFTs for many legs or a travel experience, making it an ideal match. With NFTs, it becomes possible to produce hotel or other key travel info as a unique digital token, where the info is stored in a decentralized manner. The crucial info NFT contains can be automatically updated whenever new information becomes available, keeping the latest version of data for all parties involved. With better management tools and systems developed for the Web3 era, the Camino Network enables all stakeholders in the industry to benefit from a secure and transparent ecosystem.

NFTs can also help with the tokenization of assets of inventory, potentially bringing a new marketplace where everything about the travel experience can be sold and exchanged for a much wider range of personalization. An NFT can act as digital ownership proof for travel-related assets, from flight tickets to hotel rooms and loyalty points, introducing a new level of reliability to the industry by solving fraud and payment risks. It also takes the stress out of last-minute decisions, a common headache for both customers and airlines, by making it easy to resell any tickets for both customers and airlines. Camino Network can serve as the basis for an NFT-based voucher platform to remove manual and lengthy processes from redeeming travel coupons with smart contracts. With a broad range of use cases, NFTs will provide new revenue streams and pave the way for new business models within the travel industry.

The next chapter of travel is taking off

To provide a safe and secure environment for Web3 developers, over 200,000 lines of code written for the Camino blockchain were audited by prominent cybersecurity service provider Hexens. The team also launched a hacker bounty hunt for the Camino Network to prove its reliability.

Web3 developers and travel companies who aim to transform the industry have already started working on the Camino Network for a wide range of decentralized apps. The Camino Network invites everyone — both from the travel industry and the Web3 space — to join hands to prepare an age-old industry for the next generation of travelers.

"How does quantum computing impact the finance industry?","Quantum computing could revolutionize finance by solving complex problems quickly, improving risk management and enhancing cybersecurity measures.","1.
How does quantum computing help the finance industry?

QCs are only in the developmental stage; experiments are already showing their great potential in the finance industry.

Based on the World Economic Forum’s estimate from 2022, national governments have invested more than $25 billion in quantum computing research, and over $1 billion in venture capital deals were closed in the previous year. Quantum computers (QCs) are in the early stages of development, and there are many technical challenges that need to be overcome before they can become practical tools for everyday use.

Nevertheless, they have already demonstrated great potential for applications in a wide range of fields. QCs have the ability to solve complex mathematical problems exponentially faster than classical computers, making them ideal for several complex tasks. The finance industry is one of the first runners in testing the technology. However, from the military to pharmaceuticals, logistics and manufacturing companies, several industries are experimenting with QC.

The mentioned features of QCs can have an enormous impact on the future of financial services. There are several tasks where financial forecasting and financial modeling can be supported by QCs for faster and more accurate processes. Notably, portfolio optimization, risk management and asset pricing are some of the most mentioned examples. However, their potential advantages and threats to cryptography make it important for financial service providers to monitor the technology.

Collaboration is crucial in the area of QCs due to the fact that technology and software development enable the revolution. Accelerating programs are initiated by the largest tech companies for experimentation with their hardware, software or cloud solutions, such as IBM, Microsoft, Google or Amazon. 

Goldman Sachs has partnered with Microsoft Azure Quantum to explore the use of QCs for pricing. JPMorgan is experimenting with quantum solutions for optimization and risk management. HSBC announced its collaboration with IBM in 2022 to explore the use of QCs for pricing, portfolio optimization and risk mitigation.

2.
What are quantum computers?

QCs are new machines that can perform calculations much faster than classical computers, based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

The expression of QCs refers to a new type of machine based on the principles of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is a division of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and light on the atomic and subatomic scales. The most valued property of QCs is that they perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers.

Classical computers store and process information in the unit of bits while QCs use quantum bits (or qubits). Bits represent information in a binary format and can have only two possible values: zero or one. Every piece of information going through a classical computer is essentially a long string of zeros and ones. 

Qubits can exist in multiple states at once, a property known as superposition. This means that a single qubit can represent numerous possible combinations of zeros and ones; therefore, it can process a much larger amount of information than a classical bit.

Another exciting feature of qubits is the potential of “entanglement,” where qubit pairs are created. Modifying the state of one in the pair will change the state of the other qubit in a predictable way. This property gives extra power to QCs. Increasing the number of bits in a classical computer has a linear effect on the processing power, while adding an extra qubit to a quantum machine causes an exponential increase in the processing power.

3.
Why is it so challenging to incorporate quantum computers into existing technologies?

Despite the great potential of QC, the technology and its applications need to overcome several challenging barriers.

Working with qubits is an enormously challenging scientific task because they need to be isolated in a controlled quantum state, which is extremely fragile. The smallest change in the physical environment (vibration or temperature) can cause an imbalance, which is the collapse of the superposition. Complex preventive actions are required, such as supercooled refrigerators, insulation or vacuum chambers to protect the system from losing its equilibrium.

Another aspect of the challenge is that as a different paradigm, QCs require not only completely new hardware and software but also algorithmic solutions. Numerous articles discuss the potential of QCs in machine learning, artificial intelligence or cryptography. Less often emphasized that it does not only mean using QCs to run algorithms designed for classical computers (quantum-enhanced) but building completely new algorithms, which are leveraging the features of QCs.

QCs in banking can be a game changer due to the potential of multiplying the speed and volume of calculations and transactions. However, different financial institutions only started to experiment with their own quantum algorithms and the limits of those potentials are not clear yet. Quantum algorithms are algorithms that take advantage of the unique properties of quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement.

One example of quantum algorithms is Grover’s algorithm, which can be used to search large, unstructured databases of financial data more quickly than classical algorithms. For example, it could be used to search for specific financial transactions or to identify patterns in financial data. Another example is Shor’s algorithm, which enables one to factor in large numbers more quickly than classical algorithms. 

4.
What are the benefits of quantum computing for the finance industry?

The finance industry is optimistic about quantum computing. Tasks such as portfolio optimization, risk management and asset pricing have a great chance to be beneficiaries.

Grover’s and Shor’s algorithms can be applied to portfolio optimization. Portfolio optimization involves finding the optimal combination of investments to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Besides providing faster and more accurate calculations the technology can enable more flexible optimization strategies that take into account a wider range of factors, such as environmental, social and governance factors.

Another example could be asset pricing. Asset pricing is the process of estimating the value of financial assets such as stocks, bonds and derivatives. Traditional methods for pricing financial assets rely on complex mathematical models, such as Monte Carlo simulations, which involve simulating a large number of possible outcomes for a given financial asset and then using these simulations to estimate its value. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can handle, for example, complex financial instruments, such as options, that have non-linear payoffs.

Here’s the billion-dollar question: Can quantum computers predict the stock market? While QCs may have some advantages over classical computers in certain financial modeling tasks, it is unlikely that they will be able to predict the stock market with complete accuracy. Additionally, as with any new technology, quantum computing also poses its own unique challenges and limitations that need to be addressed before its full potential in financial applications can be realized.

Many financial services companies have high expectations of QC’s effect on risk management. It involves identifying, assessing, prioritizing risks and taking actions to mitigate or manage those risks. Every step involves mathematical modeling and simulations for predicting risk outcomes, and time and accuracy play a crucial role in the process. Cybersecurity is an important part of risk management that can be enhanced by enabling more advanced encryption methods.

Encryption became a crucial measure in the banking industry that protects sensitive information from unauthorized access. It is used to secure communication channels between banking systems, websites and mobile apps and protect data on servers, databases and backups. Additionally, encryption is used to generate digital signatures that help ensure the authenticity of documents and prevent unauthorized modification or tampering of sensitive documents.

5.
Why is quantum computing a double-edged sword in cryptography?

Cryptography and blockchain technology will surely not stay untouched by quantum computing; however, the direction remains a question.

Quantum computing presents both a threat and an opportunity for cryptography. While it has the potential to break many of the current encryption methods, it also has the potential to create new and more secure methods that are immune to attacks by classical computers.

QCs are exponentially faster than classical computers, which means they can quickly solve mathematical problems that classical computers would take years, decades or even centuries to solve. This includes the mathematical problems that underlie many of the encryption schemes used to secure digital communication and transactions. 

For example, Shor’s algorithm can be used to efficiently factor large numbers, which is the basis for many public-key encryption algorithms such as RSA (the abbreviation refers to the name of the creators, Rivest–Shamir–Adleman).

However, quantum cryptography can also be used to create new cryptographic methods that are securer than classical methods. For example, quantum key distribution is a method to generate and distribute a secret key between two parties, the confidentiality and integrity of the information being exchanged can be ensured, even if a malicious entity intercepts the communication.

The mentioned features create some uncertainty in the future of QCs in blockchain technologies. It has the potential to break current encryption methods used in blockchain, which could compromise the security of digital assets and transactions. At the same time, researchers are working on developing quantum-resistant encryption methods for blockchains to counter this threat, such as CRYSTALS-Kyber public-key encryption by IBM. Additionally, QCs can enhance blockchains by increasing their processing speed and scalability, which can lead to more efficient and secure transactions. ","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-does-quantum-computing-impact-the-finance-industry"

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Customer service

Chatbots are increasingly being used in the banking industry to provide efficient and cost-effective customer service. Customers can interact with chatbots to get answers to their banking-related queries and resolve issues related to their accounts, transactions or products. Chatbots can also be programmed to provide personalized responses to customers, enhancing the customer experience.

Chatbots can provide 24/7 customer support, allowing customers to get assistance at any time of the day or night without the need to wait for a customer service representative. This can significantly reduce wait times and improve customer satisfaction.

Furthermore, chatbots can handle multiple queries simultaneously, enabling them to handle a high volume of customer requests efficiently. This can save banks time and money, as fewer customer service representatives may be needed. For instance, the chatbot of Bank of America’s virtual assistant, Erica, can help customers with a range of tasks, such as checking their account balances, making transfers and even disputing charges.

Personal finance

Chatbots can also be used for personal finance purposes, such as budgeting, financial advice and investment guidance. They can provide personalized recommendations based on a user’s spending habits and financial goals and help users keep track of their expenses and savings. For example, a chatbot could help a user set a budget and remind them when they are approaching their spending limit in a particular category. 

Furthermore, chatbots can assist users in finding the best deals on financial products, such as credit cards, loans and insurance policies. They can compare different options and provide recommendations based on the user’s needs and preferences. For instance, Cleo, a chatbot from Cleo AI, can help users track their spending habits and provide suggestions on how to save money.

Loan applications

Chatbots can be used in loan applications to streamline the process and provide 24/7 support to customers. The chatbot can guide users through the application process, answer questions and provide real-time updates on the status of their application. By automating parts of the loan application process, chatbots can help reduce errors and processing times, leading to a faster turnaround time for loan approvals. Chatbots can also assist in collecting necessary documentation and verifying user information.

Additionally, they can use natural language processing (NLP) to assess the creditworthiness of a user and recommend loan options based on their financial situation. For example, HSBC’s Jade chatbot can help customers apply for personal loans and mortgages by providing assistance and collecting necessary information.

Account management

Chatbots can help customers manage their accounts by providing account balance information, setting up automatic payments and updating personal information. For example, Wells Fargo’s chatbot, named Greenhouse, can help customers manage their accounts by providing balance information, setting up payments and even tracking spending patterns.

Fraud prevention

Chatbots can also be utilized in fraud prevention in banking. Fraudulent activities can lead to significant financial losses for both customers and financial institutions. Chatbots can help prevent fraud by monitoring and analyzing customer behavior and transactions in real-time to detect suspicious activity. Chatbots can also be programmed to send alerts to customers in case of unusual activity or suspicious transactions.

Additionally, chatbots can assist customers in reporting fraudulent activity and provide guidance on the next steps to take. With the help of chatbots, banks can improve their fraud prevention strategies and mitigate financial risks. For instance, the chatbot from Mastercard, named Kai, can help identify suspicious activities and alert customers of potential fraud attempts on their accounts.

Investment assistance

Chatbots can provide investment advice and portfolio management recommendations based on customer preferences, risk appetite and investment goals. For example, the chatbot of Wealthfront can provide investment advice and portfolio management recommendations based on customers’ preferences and risk appetite.

There’s a beacon of light in the bear market tunnel. The Salvadoran nonprofit program Mi Primer Bitcoin, or My First Bitcoin, has raised over 1 Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,601

 in donations — not from venture capitalists and investors but from generous Bitcoin education advocates worldwide.

Donations flooded in from countries like Venezuela, Poland and Canada as hundreds of people worldwide sent satoshis (Bitcoin’s smallest denomination) over the Lightning Network to fund the expansion of My First Bitcoin’s Bitcoin Diploma program.

We did it! We crowdfunded 1 BTC on @geyserfund in April

A matching donation from @Bitcoinbeach put us over the top last night--what a way to end the month :)

Huge THANK YOU to the 250+ donors who got us here

This is a movement that we are all part of & edu is how we will win

— Mi Primer Bitcoin (@MyfirstBitcoin_) May 1, 2023

Cointelegraph reached out to John Dennehy, founder of My First Bitcoin, to understand how the crowdfunding campaign reached 1 BTC in less than three weeks. Dennehy told Cointelegraph, “Bitcoin’s greatest potential is empowering the individual, and making it easy to donate value is a big part of that.”

“Bitcoin crowdfunding makes it possible for anyone to participate, which is revolutionary when compared to the existing fiat system that restricts who can participate. This is a way to level the playing field.”

Unlike PayPal or GoFundMe, Bitcoin’s censorship-resistant, self-sovereign properties make it one of the most efficient ways to send money online. Plus, it’s far cheaper. Money is sent over the layer-2 Lightning Network, which costs a fraction of legacy payment services. Dennehy explained:

“Bitcoin crowdfunding is an example of how Bitcoin allows people to take control of their own money.”

The crowdfunding campaign was boosted by the efforts of Bitcoin Beach, the Bitcoin circular community in El Zonte on El Salvador’s Pacific coast. Bitcoin Beach was the spark that led to BTC being declared legal tender in El Salvador in 2021. On April 27, Bitcoin Beach declared it would match all donations to the project until midnight on April 27:

For those of you waiting to donate till #BTC goes back to $60k You can effectively do that for the next hour——-For the next hour we will match your donations to ⁦@MyfirstBitcoin_⁩ so double your giving power Primer Bitcoin 2- 2023 Expansion | Geyser https://t.co/F4w29zXNYQ

— Bitcoin Beach (@Bitcoinbeach) April 27, 2023

Regardless, the campaign had begun with lightning-fast levels of generosity. MetaMick, the founder of Bitcoin crowdfunding platform Geyser — which My First Bitcoin used for its fundraiser — told Cointelegraph, “Definitely the biggest educational project on Geyser ever! Insane traction in just a day!” He added that it was the third-largest crowdfund ever on Geyser after just one day.

Despite Bitcoin’s price grinding lower — and wiping out traders — the Bitcoin community continues to build and educate. As Dennehy summed up:

“We are inspired every day by the support we receive from the Bitcoin community. We couldn’t do what we do without it.”

To date, My First Bitcoin has educated 6,000 students in El Salvador. Cointelegraph attended its second graduation ceremony in San Marcos in November 2021.

Consensus, the annual crypto and blockchain conference, attracted over 15,000 attendees, 220 sponsors and 410 speakers to its 2023 edition in Austin, Texas, despite recent regulatory struggles around cryptocurrency adoption in the United States. 

The turnout at Consensus 2023 demonstrated that U.S.-based companies and international organizations are still very much interested in implementing Web3 technology into their business models.

Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank — a Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the conference attracted serious ecosystem participants, saying, “We’ve seen during crypto winters before where Consensus gets overrun with high time preference people and companies (for example, multiple Lambo’s parked out front of the New York Hilton in 2018), and in bust years the low-time preference people and companies just keep building. This year was the latter.”

Businesses discuss Web3 strategies

Several large organizations were present at Consensus 2023, with Mastercard, Google, Robinhood and Coinbase, among others, gathering to discuss their Web3 strategies.

James Tromans, head of Web3 at Google Cloud, told Cointelegraph about some blockchain-based initiatives the company has recently launched.

“At the end of last year, Google Cloud announced Blockchain Node Engine, which allows users and developers to run an Ethereum node without having to manage or support it themselves,” he said.

Recent: Will compromise on anonymous crypto appease US regulators, spur adoption?

At Consensus, the firm announced that it had expanded support for the Blockchain Node Engine to Polygon proof-of-stake, in addition to Ethereum.

Tromans added that Google Cloud knows what Polygon has been doing in the zero-knowledge (ZK) space, noting that Polygon ZK Ethereum virtual machines (zkEVM) and Polygon supernets will benefit from the provision of Google Cloud’s infrastructure and developer tools.

Moreover, Tromans pointed out that Google Cloud’s startup program will help onboard companies interested in building on Web3 using existing Google Cloud products. “Polygon is an important part of this initiative, as they have provided a $3 million contribution from their venture fund to get this off the ground with us,” he said.

Global financial services giant Mastercard announced its “Mastercard Crypto Credential” solution during Consensus. Raj Dhamodharan, head of crypto and blockchain at Mastercard, stated during a fireside discussion at Consensus that he is “excited about the underlying potential of blockchain technology” due to its ability to store and move value seamlessly.

However, Dhamodharan explained that “this potential is not fully realized today,” so Mastercard has started working on several products like Mastercard Crypto Credential.

“I believe that once you have the right building blocks necessary for safety and simplicity, you can have more businesses building and relying on the basic utility of storing and moving value,” Dhamodharan said on stage.

Conversations continued at side events

While there were 10 dedicated stages for 285 panels during Consensus, many side events allowed important conversations to continue outside of the conference.

For example, zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) were widely discussed at Consensus, but in-depth conversations around ZK-proofs took place at the “ZK360” event hosted by Mina Protocol. Evan Shapiro, CEO of the Mina Foundation and co-founder of the Mina Protocol, told Cointelegraph that the goal of ZK360 was for attendees to learn about the latest advancements in ZK-proofs and how these can be applied in the real world. “Web3 needs both privacy and verified computation. ZK-proofs provide both of those at a time when applications are needing these features to be more effective, decentralized and scalable,” he said.

Other layer-1 blockchain networks like Ripple and Algorand hosted side events, allowing Consensus attendees to better understand specific blockchain offerings while networking with community members. These events also presented an opportunity for non-Consensus attendees to learn about important topics within the Web3 sector. 

Lacking an international presence

While the turnout during Consensus 2023 was notable, some industry experts highlighted that the conference lacked an international presence.

Yat Siu, chairman of Animoca Brands — a venture capital company focused on blockchain-based games — told Cointelegraph that regions in Asia like Japan and Hong Kong are offering a progressive and welcoming regulatory environment for crypto adoption. He noted that most people he spoke with at Consensus seemed surprised or even skeptical at this. He said:

“I think that a larger presence of overseas participants would have helped allow Consensus participants to better understand the scope of excitement and opportunity that exists outside of the United States. I would love to see a stronger international presence at Consensus next year.”

Despite this, Siu said that Consensus 2023 was a well-attended, high-energy conference overall. “I was surprised at the level of deal-making activity that was taking place, even if the narrative was that the U.S. was negative on crypto,” he said.

Echoing Siu was Keith Grossman, president of enterprise at MoonPay. He told Cointelegraph that he was impressed to see so many executives from some of the largest companies in attendance at Consensus. “Deals were being discussed, and I believe we will look back at Consensus 2023 recognizing it represented a maturation in the industry as it relates to how Web3 technologies can be deployed in a meaningful manner for businesses and their customers.”

DeFi exec breaks down what it takes to attract institutions to staking

In episode 18 of Cointelegraph’s Hashing It Out podcast, Elisha Owusu Akyaw sits down with Matt Leisinger, chief product officer at Alluvial — a software development company supporting the implementation of the Liquid Collective protocol — to explore the world of crypto staking and its potential to attract institutional investors. Leisinger explains the Liquid Collective and shares his thoughts on the future of Ether

 staking after the Shanghai upgrade. 

Matt Leisinger started his carrier in the traditional finance sector and shifted to trading cryptocurrencies in 2016. Leisinger invested in the Ethereum ecosystem and contributed to projects providing liquid staking services. Leisinger explains liquid staking as allowing users to stake assets on the blockchain and mint a receipt token that represents the staked assets, which maintains liquidity while users earn rewards and secure the network.

As institutional investment in cryptocurrency skyrockets, some are looking at ways to add staking to their portfolio. According to Leisinger, most of these firms would naturally choose liquid staking, but hurdles around Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements, transparency, tokenholder privileges, and counter-party risks must first be dealt with. Leisinger explains that Alluvial provides a solution for enterprises by dealing with these hurdles that slow down adoption.

On regulations, Leisinger says that firms like Alluvial “really want” regulatory clarity. According to him, there are two types of staking: direct staking and actively managed staking. Both have different implications from a regulatory perspective around token ownership, security and transparency. Leisinger believes liquid staking is better positioned to withstand regulatory pressure due to its transparency.

What’s more, Leisinger admits that a lack of regulatory clarity has had a chilling effect on institutional staking. Nevertheless, the Alluvial exec is optimistic that new milestones like the Ethereum Shapella upgrade will derisk participation in staking and attract interest.

UK reviews AI development: It can ‘drive substantial economic growth’

The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said it would examine AI’s development, deployment and social impact.

The United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has turned its attention to artificial intelligence (AI) after announcing an examination of the impact of the technology on consumers and the economy.

On May 4, the regulator said it would be looking at the development and deployment of foundation models — applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT — against key principles. Those include safety, transparency, fairness and accountability, among others. 

Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, commented that since AI tools “burst” into the public sphere, regulators have had their eye on it.

“It’s a technology developing at speed and has the potential to transform the way businesses compete as well as drive substantial economic growth.“

She continued by deeming it “crucial” that businesses and consumers in the U.K. have access to the potential benefits of AI technologies while being shielded from fake information. AI-generated fakes have already started populating the web, resulting in lawsuits. 

The initial review will examine the competitive market for AI foundation models and their usage. Regulators plan to monitor how they can expand and present opportunities, along with risks to competition and consumers.

The CMA says its goal is to help the technology develop in ways that “ensure open, competitive markets and effective consumer protection.“

Additionally, the review is intended to produce “guiding principles” for the protection of consumers and support healthy competition as the technologies develop. A report on the findings is scheduled to be published in September 2023.

This announcement follows the publication of a white paper on AI from the U.K. government in March 2023.

On April 25, the U.K. prime minister and technology secretary revealed funding of 100 million British pounds ($124.8 million) to support a task force to accelerate the country’s AI readiness.

Centralized crypto exchanges saw a dip in trading volumes in April for the first time in three months as digital assets cooled off from a hot first quarter.

According to blockchain data provider Kaiko, trading volumes on centralized exchanges have fallen following three consecutive months of gains.

April’s volumes were almost half of those in March at roughly $500 billion, according to the data. The month was the lowest so far this year in terms of volumes, with March being the highest.

The data provider noted that volumes had reached pre-FTX collapse levels until April's decline. It also noted that markets remain above 2020 levels in terms of trade volumes.

“Overall, however, the crypto market remains significantly larger than it was before the 2020 bull run,” said Kaiko.

According to data from blockchain analyst Lars0x, legitimate centralized exchange spot volume decreased by 43.8% to $400.5 billion in April.

“The majority of the decrease is due to Binance adding back fees on BTC pairs,” Lars0x noted. Binance remains the market leader, with a dominance of 71.6%, according to their data.

Furthermore, Binance has a 24-hour trading volume of around $10 billion, which is significantly larger than its nearest rival, Coinbase with $1.1 billion, according to CoinGecko.

In late April, Cointelegraph reported that Binance’s Bitcoin balance increased by over 50,000 BTC, roughly $1.5 billion, in a month. The move preceded the sell-off as BTC hit heavy resistance just over the $30,000 level.

United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase has seen its app downloads also in decline in recent months as trading volumes dwindle in the sideways market, according to a report from Yahoo News.

Tom Grant, the vice president of research at Apptopia — a research firm that tracks app usage metrics — said the shrinking app usage paints a bearish picture for the company.

The CEX volume decline comes as digital asset markets began to retreat from their 2023 highs in mid-April. On April 16, total market capitalization hit an eleven-month high of $1.34 trillion. However, markets have declined 7.5% to $1.24 trillion since then.

Since the beginning of the year, crypto markets have gained 50% but they have remained largely range bound for the past six weeks or so.

Analysts have hinted that the correction is likely to continue as markets have been somewhat overheated for the first quarter of the year.

US regional bank shares sink despite Fed calling banking system ‘sound’

PacWest Bancorp was the hardest hit bank after-hours on May 3, falling over 50% following a reported plan to explore strategic options.

Share prices of several United States regional banks tanked in after-hours trading on May 3, despite Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell calling the banking sector “sound” and “resilient” just hours before.

One such regional bank, PacWest Bancorp, fell a whopping 52.5% in after-hours trading after Bloomberg reported that the bank would explore strategic options on May 4. It has been seen by some as another bank to potentially fall amid a U.S. banking crisis. 

The bank is reportedly considering a sale or capital raising, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Meanwhile, Western Alliance Bancorp (22.4%), Metropolitan Bank (16.2%) and HomeStreet (7.8%) were among the other hardest-hit regional banks.

Metropolitan Bank once offered services to crypto firms but closed its digital asset vertical in January because the firm wasn’t content with how the cryptocurrency industry was developing.

Western Alliance Bancorp also integrated blockchain-based payment solutions for its client base from the firm’s blockchain and digital asset branch.

PacWest, $PACW: ⬇️60%
Western Alliance, $WAL: ⬇️30%
Metropolitan Bank, $MCB: ⬇️20%
Valley National, $VLY: ⬇️15%
HomeStreet, $HMST: ⬇️11%
Zions Bank, $ZION: ⬇️10%
KeyCorp, $KEY: ⬇️8%

Seems like time to #HODL

— Acquire.Fi (@Acquire_Fi) May 4, 2023

Powell’s attempt to quell concerns about the banking sector came as he announced that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates another 25 basis points:

“Conditions in [the banking] sector have broadly improved since early March and the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. We will continue to monitor conditions in the sector.""

Powell added that Fed was “committed to learning the right lessons from this episode, and we’ll work to prevent events like these from happening again.”

First Republic Bank’s collapse was the second-biggest bank failure of late. Problems first surfaced on April 26, when the news about a government receivership broke out, causing the bank’s share price to plummet 20% in hours.

Several on Crypto Twitter have mocked Powell for stating that conditions in the banking sector “have broadly improved” since early March.

Will Clemente, the founder of digital asset analysis firm Reflexivity Research, tweeted to his 680,300 Twitter followers that the collapse of five banks — SVB, Silvergate, Signature, First Republic and PacWest — “sounds like a very sound and resilient banking system…”

FED Chair Jerome Powell says “banking system is sound, resilient.”

Twitter user Zerohedge made fun of Powell by noting to the1.6 million followers that over $500 billion has been wiped out from “bank failures” in the past month alone.

PacWest Bancorp’s 52% fall is set to wipe out about $340 million from its market cap, which was $772 million at the May 3 close, according to Google Finance.

Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT have become the latest way for “bad actors” to distribute malware, scams and spam, research from Meta’s security team warns.

The basic building blocks of DeFi and NFTs in one place - the ABCs of Crypto Report by Cointelegraph Research

A May 1 research report from Facebook parent Meta’s security team found 10 malware families posing as ChatGPT and similar artificial intelligence tools in March, some of which were found in various browser extensions, noting: 

“Since March alone, our security analysts have found around 10 malware families posing as ChatGPT and similar tools to compromise accounts across the internet.”

Meta explained that these “bad actors” — malware operators, scammers, spammers and the like — have moved to AI because it’s the “latest wave” of what is capturing “people’s imagination and excitement.”

The research comes amid a major interest in artificial intelligence, with ChatGPT, in particular, capturing much attention brought to AI. 

“For example, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-related tools,” it added.

Meta security said that some of these “malicious extensions” included operations with ChatGPT functionality which coexisted alongside the malware.

The firm’s security team then explained that bad actors tend to move to where the latest craze is, referencing the hype around digital currency and the scams that have come from it:

“This is not unique to the generative AI space. As an industry, we’ve seen this across other topics popular in their time, such as crypto scams fueled by the interest in digital currency.”

“The generative AI space is rapidly evolving, and bad actors know it,” they added, stressing the need to be vigilant.

Guy Rosen, Meta’s chief security officer, went one step further in a recent interview with Reuters, stating that “ChatGPT is the new crypto” for these bad actors.

It should, however, be noted that Meta is now making its own developments in generative AI.

Meta AI is currently building various forms of AI to help improve its augmented and artificial reality technologies.

Despite being heavily invested in the Metaverse, AI is now Meta’s single largest investment, according to chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.

Cointelegraph contacted OpenAI — the team behind ChatGPT — for comment.

36% of the top 1,000 crypto projects went silent on blogging this year

A whopping 35.8% of the world’s largest crypto projects haven’t uploaded a single blog post in 2023, according to blockchain marketing agency Guerilla Buzz.

More than a third of the top 1,000 crypto projects — a term that includes both crypto companies and individual tokens — haven’t published a single new article on their respective websites in 2023.

According to a May 1 research report from blockchain marketing agency Guerilla Buzz — whose clients include the likes of CoinGecko and crypto exchange AAX — a staggering 35.8% of the top 1,000 cryptocurrency projects have failed to update their websites with any new written content this year.

Additionally, the report found that of these 1,000 projects, less than half (49.7%) had posted more than two new articles so far in 2023.

Guerilla Buzz researchers stated that the inspiration for the comparative study emerged after noticing that “many crypto companies do not prioritize strong marketing foundations.” Instead, the bulk of these companies choose to focus their efforts on “generating hype for their token sales” and “opting for short-lived growth spurts” instead of prioritizing long-term organic growth.

The paper claims that the research methodology was “straightforward” yet “labor-intensive.” First, researchers manually inspected the corresponding website of the top 1,00 crypto projects to see if they had a blog. From there, they assessed the number of articles published within recent years and checked to see how many new blog posts had been published in 2023.

Of the top 10 crypto projects, Binance’s BNB Chain was the clear blogging leader, with 59 new articles published this year. In second place was Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8735

, with 36 new posts, followed by Cardano 

ADA

$0.363

, with 12.

The paper also found that the most popular blogging website of choice for crypto projects was the free blog hosting website Medium. This is reportedly a practice that has stuck around since the days of the 2017 initial coin offering craze, where thousands of new projects popped up in the span of a few months, many of which opted for little more than a one-page website, a white paper and “lofty promises of a tech revolution.”

Related: This blockchain-based social media platform is going after TikTok

Notably, while Medium remains the go-to platform for many crypto project blogs, it may not actually be the best choice for companies seeking long-term growth.

“By relying on Medium’s platform, these companies are essentially boosting Medium’s traffic and growth instead of their own,” researchers wrote.

“While Medium’s excellent on-page SEO capabilities and high domain authority may have made it an easy choice for crypto companies seeking to generate buzz quickly, this focus on short-term gains may not be sustainable in the long run.”

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

The monetary landscape is becoming fragmented, Moody’s said, but many new payment solutions support the use of commercial bank money. For example, “We believe that digital wallets […] will support the dominance of commercial bank money as long as bank accounts remain their primary source of digital currencies.”

Nonetheless, digital wallets could threaten banks’ revenue by excluding them from the transaction process. Tokenized deposits will maintain a similar tie to commercial banks, even if other forms of tokenized assets, which remain largely untested, do not.

“CBDCs will be perceived as the safest form of digital money,” Moody’s said, referring to central bank digital currencies. They do not require deposit insurance and promise gains in inclusivity and ease of payment — especially cross-border — but technical and policy complexities hinder their adoption. The report added that most CBDCs would be intermediated, preserving the place of the commercial bank.

Cryptocurrencies got a middling review. “Despite being around for more than a decade, they still do not meet the basic functions of money,” Moody’s wrote. Even though crypto offers wide availability, round-the-clock transferability and programmability, factors such as volatility, high transaction fees, low throughput, user experience issues and, often, limited liquidity outweigh those advantages, the report claimed.

Stablecoins were treated with similar dismissiveness. “Stablecoins suffer from an intrinsic conflict of interest because their operators are incentivized to invest in riskier assets to increase revenue,” the report said. Nonetheless, “stablecoin usage may increase modestly,” the report said. Furthermore:

“That said, the market capitalization of all crypto assets has increased by more than 60% year-to-date to $1,330 billion as of 20 April 2023.”

The monetary landscape is still developing. The report said, for example:

“Digital money issued by a private company could significantly impact the payment landscape. Nevertheless, […] there has been no successful project to date, and many countries will likely not allow them to operate at scale.”

Other innovations mentioned in the report include mobile money issued by telecommunications companies and tokenized money market funds.

French Senate proposal would allow influencers to promote cryptocurrency

The Senate’s proposal comes just months after the National Assembly floated legislation banning influencer advertising for crypto products and services.

The French Senate’s Committee on Economic Affairs recently approved an amendment to pending legislation allowing registered cryptocurrency companies to hire social media influencers for advertising and promotional purposes.

According to a translation of the amendment provided by Bing, the new wording would allow companies that are registered with France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to hire influencers for their products:

“The current wording is more restrictive than the existing provisions in the Consumer Code, since it excludes the possibility for digital asset service providers (PSAN) registered with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to use commercial influence. Consequently, this amendment introduces this possibility for PSANs registered or approved with the AMF.”

In its original iteration, the bill in question called for what essentially amounted to an outright ban on influencer advertising for the crypto industry in France. Its wording limited the companies who could engage in influencer advertising to only those licensed by the AMF, a bar no cryptocurrency company currently meets.

As Paris-based law firm Beaubourg Avocats points out in an educational blog post, ""France has established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency that primarily relies on two regimes: the token sale or ICO (Initial Coin Offering) visa and the Digital Assets Service Providers ('DASPs') registration and license.”

All cryptocurrency companies operating in France are legally required to register with the AMF. So far, none have received the necessary licensing that would allow them to hire influencers to promote their products in the nation legally.

The change of language in the amendment would eliminate the licensing requirement and thus allow companies that are simply registered with the AMF to pay influencers for promotion on social media.

Crypto Twitter appears to be hailing the news as a positive step for the French influencer and cryptocurrency markets.

It does however bear mention that the change hasn’t been officially ratified yet. Along with a series of other revisions, the proposed amendment must pass through the full Senate in a plenary meeting before it faces approval by the National Assembly.

Cryptocurrencies were designed to be anonymous or pseudonymous, so there is an inherent tension when protocols come up against jurisdictional authorities. 

In the United States, the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector has jousted with regulators over the need to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules, and even over adherence to economic sanctions regimes. 

Most recently, a top U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) official suggested in a speech that it behooves the industry to verify the digital identity of its users. The CFTC has historically been friendly to the crypto sector — at least when compared with other U.S. agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission — so its views might be worth considering.

However, is it possible “for all crypto companies to distance themselves from [digital currency] mixers and anonymity-enhanced technology,” as CFTC commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero urged in an April 25 speech?

What about decentralized exchanges? Romero said central parties maintain them, and they could do KYC and AML if they wanted to. But would forcing compliance risk driving decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation abroad?

“Sure, it’s possible for companies to distance themselves from anything they want — software does what we tell it to do,” Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick, told Cointelegraph, adding:

“The real question is whether the United States, as a policy matter, wants to cut off its companies from DeFi when DeFi growth overseas is exploding.”

Whether crypto protocols have to comply with AML/KYC rules and other aspects of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) depends on whether they are “money transmitters” or “money services businesses” under the applicable state and federal laws, according to John Wagster, who heads the technology industry team at law firm Frost Brown Todd. But whether they can comply is another matter. He told Cointelegraph:

“Centralized protocols clearly have the ability to implement AML/KYC compliance, albeit at the risk of losing crypto idealists who will only use products that allow permissionless, anonymous access.”

What about DeFi projects? “Decentralized protocols can implement BSA compliance, but the individual steps must be approved by the protocol’s DAO — or another governance mechanism — and some aspect of the implementation will likely need to be performed by community members or service organizations authorized by the DAO,” Wagster added.

But the BSA isn’t the only potential challenge for crypto firms looking to set up business in the United States; it might not even be the most serious.

All companies must comply with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) “to ensure their platforms are not being used by individuals from prohibited jurisdictions,” like North Korea and Iran, or by specially designated nationals, said Wagster. However, “some aspects of OFAC compliance can be implemented autonomously through the use of third parties like Chainalysis, which provides access to its OFAC API free of charge.”

Magazine: How to control the AIs and incentivize the humans with crypto

In August 2022, OFAC sanctioned digital currency mixer Tornado Cash, which the agency accused of laundering more than $7 billion of digital currency since its creation in 2019. This included over $455 million stolen by a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group. Mixers like Tornado facilitate anonymous transactions “by obfuscating their origin, destination, and counterparties, with no attempt to determine their origin,” according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. OFAC has since prohibited U.S. firms and individuals from doing business with Tornado Cash.

Some believe that decentralized exchanges can also shut out mixers if they set their mind to it. “When the whole Tornado Cash debacle happened, decentralized exchanges like Aave and dYdX actively blocked addresses that interacted with mixers,” Justin Hartzman, CEO and co-founder of Toronto-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinSmart, told Cointelegraph. As Hartzman further explained:

“While mixers do tend to protect user identity, it is fairly easy to tell which addresses have interacted with these protocols, thanks to blockchain’s transparency.”

Still, even if crypto firms can resist anonymity-enhanced technology, would that be beneficial? Perhaps preserving privacy coins and anonymous crypto is important globally as a counterweight to growing government surveillance.

“The answer to this question is in the eye of the beholder,” said Byrne, adding that the desirability of privacy-enhancing technology is a political question. “I think the point of crypto is to make this technology so commonplace that it ceases to be a political question because its existence must be assumed.”

Privacy coins and regulations ‘don’t gel’

“If you want widespread adoption, regulations are going to be crucial,” said Hartzman, adding that “privacy coins and regulations don’t gel.” While doubting privacy coins are going away, their usability will probably remain highly “niched” and restricted, he explained. “Blockchain was never anonymous, and it won’t be moving forward in my view.”

Frost Brown Todd’s Wagster, for his part, agreed that there was a basic incompatibility at hand:

“Anonymizing technology and BSA compliance do not mix. If a protocol is required to be BSA compliant, that protocol cannot permit users to mask their identities.”

Protocols seeking high adoption by attracting institutional investors are “unlikely to defend the use of mixers because their institutional users are not going to get involved with a platform that is in danger of a government enforcement action,” continued Wagster. Meanwhile, DeFi lenders who permit anonymizers will just have to do business outside U.S. jurisdiction.

Are ‘mixers’ worth saving?

Is the verification of digital identity, as requested by the CFTC commissioner, really such a burden for crypto users, and is it worth the industry’s while to fight for “mixers” like Tornado Cash and Blender?

Anonymity is not a life and death matter for the vast majority of crypto users, in Hartzman’s view. “Most people are simply using crypto to make money and trade these radically different and exciting assets.” They aren’t using mixers either. “I would say that most don’t even know how to use these protocols.” Brown Rudnick’s Byrne added:

“Tornado Cash and Blender aren’t worth saving in my opinion, although I am sympathetic to the arguments [...] that the Treasury Department probably doesn’t, or at least it shouldn’t have the power to sanction particular technologies.”

Wagster noted that BSA requirements like AML and KYC are enforced by the U.S. Treasury through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, “not by the SEC or CFTC.”

Many centralized crypto protocols will likely embrace AML/KYC/OFAC requirements because they are widely used in the traditional financial world and “because institutional money managers may have a fiduciary duty to use compliant providers.”

On the other hand, some crypto-native DeFi protocols may want to avoid BSA compliance, Wagster said, as “compliance runs against the ethos of crypto that favors privacy and monetary freedom over the government’s desire to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.”

Mixers aren’t always used for nefarious purposes, either. People living under oppressive political regimes may use these tools to protect their wealth and freedom, CoinSmart’s Hartzman noted, but “the fact is that hackers are abusing these protocols to safely steal money from hardworking people.”

Compliance regimes can vary in importance too. KYC/AML compliance may be one thing, but sanctions evasion is arguably another. As the sad saga of Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith illustrated, it’s a surefire way to incur the wrath of U.S. authorities.

“Treasury has worked to expose components of the virtual currency ecosystem, like Tornado Cash and Blender.io, that cybercriminals use to obfuscate the proceeds from illicit cyber activity and other crimes,” declared the Treasury in August 2022.

While acknowledging that most digital currency activity is “licit,” the department said that cryptocurrencies “can be used for illicit activity, including sanctions evasion through mixers, peer-to-peer exchangers, darknet markets, and exchanges. This includes the facilitation of heists, ransomware schemes, fraud, and other cybercrimes.”

Give regulators what they want?

As a strategic matter, would it better suit the crypto sector to give U.S. regulators what they want, i.e., ID verification? Consumers have been doing it for years for other activities like opening a bank account, and if developers don’t like it, they can just set up shop outside U.S. jurisdiction.

“Ultimately, some DeFi providers will likely end up adopting AML/KYC procedures, whether they are required to or not, both to avoid unwanted government scrutiny and to attract institutional money,” predicted Wagster. “Others will hold true to their ideological preferences because that’s why they got into crypto in the first place.”

Hartzman, based in Toronto, cites the Canadian regulatory approach, which, in his view, has worked well. “All exchanges must register with the Ontario Securities Commission/Canadian Securities Administrators and undergo stringent regulatory processes and audits.”

Recent: SEC crackdown on crypto staking in the US could boost decentralization

What’s needed in the U.S., though, is a regulatory framework designed specifically for cryptocurrencies, Hartzman continued:

“It seems U.S. regulators have still not decided if cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities or something else. [SEC chair] Gary Gensler’s train-wreck of a hearing pretty much proved that these regulators are behind the eight-ball when it comes to the crypto industry.”

Byrne also suggested that U.S. regulators may arrive too late to the party to do anything forcible on the anonymity question. “While I can understand that U.S. regulators want to exercise regulatory control, I think that commercial reality outside our borders is going to start demonstrating the practical limits on their power sooner rather than later.”

Hollywood studios reject banning AI from writer’s rooms

The Writers Guild of America sent out a list of demands to Hollywood studios, including regulating AI usage in guild-affiliated projects.

Artificial intelligence (AI) brings yet another industry into a hot debate over its usage as Hollywood and the greater media industry faces petitions from the Writers Guild of America (WGA).

The WGA recently sent out a list of demands that included the regulation of AI usage on the minimum basic agreement (MBA) covered projects. It stated that AI should not be used to write or rewrite literary material nor be used as source material.

Additionally, it demanded that MBA-covered material can’t be used in training AI. In its initial statement back in March, the guild wrote:

“The WGA’s proposal to regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence or similar technologies ensures the Companies can’t use AI to undermine writers’ working standards including compensation, residuals, separated rights and credits.”

However, Hollywood studios have officially rejected the demands and countered with an offer of “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.”

This issue pertaining to AI usage was one of many, including compensation and working conditions, that pushed the WGA to go on an authorized strike in Los Angeles on May 2 for the first time in 15 years.

— Writers Guild of America, East (@WGAEast) May 3, 2023

Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator for the WGA, called the proposal “reasonable” and said that AI should be kept “out of the business of writing television and movies.” She also commented that some members of the guild had penned the name “plagiarism machine” for AI.

AI tools are already being implemented in Hollywood for touching up visuals and de-aging actors’ appearances, among other things. 

Hollywood production studios’ stance of openness to emerging technologies, such as AI, differs from the stance of major companies in other creative industries like the music industry.

The initial response of Universal Music Group after AI-generated music started popping up on streaming services was a manhunt to get them removed, along with lawsuits. Though some artists themselves with established names in the industry are encouraging the usage of the technology.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020.

Crypto.com announced “Amy” on May 2. The crypto exchange’s new AI companion is built to inform users about the industry, including real-time token prices and projects, historical events, and more. According to the announcement, Amy, which uses ChatGPT as its base, is currently in the pilot phase to “gather learnings” before future expansion.

Abhi Bisarya, the executive vice president of product at Crypto.com, says the company is “bullish” on the usage of AI in crypto.

“As with other businesses and sectors, we see incredible potential and opportunity in the convergence of AI with the crypto industry and our platform specifically.”

A Crypto.com spokesperson told Cointelegraph that although these are the “early days” of generative AI, there is potential for “massive positive implications” for many industries if done responsibly.

“This is particularly the case for crypto when it comes to helping educate users about the underlying technology and financial services more broadly.“

As for drawbacks, the spokesperson said they expect a lot of feedback from this AI pilot, which will be “integrated into future upgrades.“

Nasdaq-listed mining company Bitdeer Technologies Group and Bhutan’s sovereign investment arm Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) have teamed up to create eco-friendly and carbon-free digital asset mining operations in the Kingdom of Bhutan. 

In an announcement sent to Cointelegraph, Bitdeer and DHI said they would launch the partnership by creating a closed-end fund with an approximate value of $500 million. The firms aim to start their fundraising efforts at the end of May to attract investments from around the world.

Bitdeer chairman Jihan Wu expressed enthusiasm about collaborating with DHI. According to Wu, the company will work with DHI to utilize Bhutan’s zero-emission energy to support blockchain technologies, which will eventually establish an unchangeable foundation for a universal store of value. He also added that the fund would provide a platform to develop international stakeholder networks that will contribute to Bhutan’s tech sector.

Meanwhile, DHI CEO Ujjwal Deep Dahal also expressed enthusiasm about collaborating with Bitdeer on the project. He explained that DHI’s goal is to enhance the lives of Bhutanese people and believes that the partnership with Bitdeer is a step toward a more sustainable domestic economy. 

The partnership is expected to create employment opportunities in various fields, including engineering, project management, and supervisory and supportive roles. Moreover, it is expected to stimulate economic growth and generate revenue in foreign currency for the local community and the country.

The United Kingdom is set to ban cold calls selling financial products, including insurance and cryptocurrencies, to crack down on fraud. The National Crime Agency estimates that fraud costs the country approximately £7 billion ($8.7 billion) annually.

The U.K. government announced its new fraud strategy, pledging 400 new jobs to update its approach to intelligence-led policing. The government will work alongside the telecoms regulator, the Office of Communications, commonly known as Ofcom, to use new technology to counter phone number “spoofing,” which would prevent fraudsters from impersonating legitimate U.K. phone numbers.

According to Bloomberg, wire fraud is now the most prevalent crime in the U.K., with 1 in 15 people falling victim to it. To ensure more victims of fraud get their money back, the government aims to introduce laws that require financial institutions to reimburse victims of authorized fraud.

A report published on Jan. 29 by media outlets, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Observer, shows that organized crime syndicates are utilizing the U.K. as their operational base owing to the region’s “lenient regulations.“ Registering a company in the U.K. costs as little as 12 British pounds ($14.85). It requires no form of identification, making it easy for fraudulent companies to register there and gain sham credibility.

The U.K. government has been trying to clamp down on cryptocurrency companies operating in the region. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mandated that all companies engaged in crypto asset activity register with it per the existing Financial Services and Markets Act rules for the digital assets market.

However, the FCA has adopted a strict approach to granting approvals, leading to several crypto-related businesses operating as unregistered entities. The regulator appears to be striving to balance providing a secure environment for investors and promoting innovation in the industry.

U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reportedly said in a statement that scammers “ruin lives in seconds, deceiving people in the most despicable ways in order to line their pockets.“ He pledged to fight these fraudsters wherever they attempt to hide. The government also promised to put an end to methods commonly used by scammers to reach thousands of people at once, such as “SIM farms.“ The use of mass-texting services will also be reviewed to prevent these technologies from falling into the hands of criminals.

A cryptocurrency YouTuber has been served a lawsuit through a tweet after a United States court allowed the action, as lawyers claimed they couldn’t serve him through other means.

The May 2 order from a Florida district court judge granted The Moskowitz Law Firm permission to serve legal notice to crypto YouTuber Tom Nash via a tweet.

Nash, believed to reside in Georgia, is the last of ten defendants named in a class-action lawsuit against influencers alleged to have promoted the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX without disclosing their compensation.

On May 2, the firm tweeted its notice to Nash and mentioned his Twitter handle in the post, thereby giving him legal notice of the lawsuit.

The filing set out instructions on how Nash would be served using Twitter.

A legal notice URL was required to be shared by the law firm through its official Twitter account, tagging Nash’s Twitter account.

Moskowitz was also required to send the URL in an email to his publicly known email address.

The filing states Nash’s frequent internet use suggests that it is a reliable way of contacting him. It noted:

“Nash has an established Internet-based business, utilizes electronic means, including Twitter, as reliable forms of contact; and has publicly acknowledged [a] personal email address.”

According to the filing, when lawyers previously emailed Nash on an address he had publicly posted, it didn’t bounce back, which suggested Nash received the suit and his “e-mail address is valid and operational.”

A federal ruling allows the district court to “order an alternate method for service to be executed on foreign defendants,” provided it isn’t against international agreements and is likely to effectively notify the defendant.

It further explained that Georgia and the U.S. are parties to The Hague Convention, which provides a standardized method for serving legal documents between countries that are signatories of the treaty.

The other nine defendants comprise seven YouTubers, including Graham Stephan, Brian Jung and Ben Armstrong, known as “BitBoy Crypto.” The talent management company that handled the promotion of FTX, Creators Agency and its founder Erika Kullberg, are also named.

Armstrong had missed a court appearance on April 20 to address his alleged “harassment towards plaintiffs’ counsel.”

Instead of attending the court hearing, Armstrong posted pictures of himself on a beach in the Bahamas on Twitter and openly mocked the order.

Cointelegraph contacted Nash for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

The IMF's Kristalina Georgieva erred on the side of caution regarding retail CBDCs in a May 1 interview at the Milken Institute’s 2023 Global Conference.

Georgieva explained the IMF considers retail CBDCs to have far more room for error than wholesale CBDCs.

“We think that wholesale CBDCs can be put in place with fairly little space for undesirable surprises, whereas retail CBDCs completely transform the financial system in a way that we don’t quite know what consequences it could bring.”

Retail CBDCs are state-backed virtual currencies issued by central banks for use by consumers and businesses.

Wholesale CBDCs are similarly central bank-issued but are designed to allow financial institutions to carry reserve deposits with a central bank.

The IMF is collaborating with about 50 countries to ensure best practices are adopted, Georgieva said, which she expects to have a huge influence on the banks and economies in the future.

“We are engaging with countries, we work with some 50 countries now on this very topic,” the IMF executive said.

“We will see a very significant transformation that comes from CBDCs.”

Georgieva noted that “even” the United States is engaging in CBDC development now, which led her to conclude that “the future” of CBDCs is now here:

“Even in the U.S. where that was for quite some time a topic of not great interest, now there is engagement, and for the right reason. The future has arrived.”

The IMF announced on April 12 that it will publish a CBDC handbook to help central banks with CBDC design and implementation. The financial agency of the United Nations said the decision came following “unprecedented” levels of interest from nations around the world.

Balaji pays out his crazy $1M Bitcoin bet, 97% under price target

The former Coinbase exec settled the high profile wager 45 days ahead of time but remains convinced that a “fiat crisis” is inevitable.

A $1 million Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,600

 price bet has been closed out 97% under its target price, with backer Balaji Srinivasan choosing instead to donate a total of $1.5 million to three different entities as a settlement.

On May 2, Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer at Coinbase, said the bet had been “closed out by mutual agreement” 45 days ahead of time.

As a settlement, Srinivasan paid pseudonymous Twitter user and self-titled “hyperinflation doubter” James Medlock $500,000, donated $500,000 to Bitcoin Core developers and gave an additional $500,000 to the non-profit charity Give Directly.

— Balaji (@balajis) May 2, 2023

“I settled the bet ahead of time and donated even more than I had committed,” Srinivasan tweeted.

“I’m not in the habit of publicly burning a million bucks,” Srinivasan added, explaining the reason for closing out the wager around $970,000 below his target price of a $1 million per Bitcoin was because he believes “in the public good” and citizens can no longer “rely on the public sector […] to tell us when something's wrong.”

“I spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there’s something wrong with the economy, and that it's not going to be a ‘soft landing’ like Powell promises — but something much worse.”

Despite giving away a total of $1.5 million, Srinivasan remains convinced the American economy will eventually reach a state of hyperinflation. Under his view, investors will rush to secure the value of their rapidly-depreciating dollars in Bitcoin, rapidly driving the value of the asset to reach a price of $1 million.

The high-profile wager was initiated on March 17 following a disagreement between Srinivasan and pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock. Medlock initially tweeted that he would bet someone $1 million that the U.S. dollar would not enter any state of hyperinflation.

The conditions of the bet stipulated that if Bitcoin’s price failed to reach $1 million by June 17, Medlock would receive $1 million in the dollar-pegged stablecoin USD Coin 

USDC

$1.00

 as well as an additional 1 BTC. On the contrary, if the price of an individual Bitcoin were to be valued at $1 million by the same date, then Balaji could keep the 1 BTC and the $1 million in USDC.

I will take that bet.
You buy 1 BTC.
I will send $1M USD.
This is ~40:1 odds as 1 BTC is worth ~$26k.
The term is 90 days.
All we need is a mutually agreed custodian who will still be there to settle this in the event of digital dollar devaluation.
If someone knows how to do this… https://t.co/hhPr522PQu pic.twitter.com/6Aav9KeJpe

Bitcoin is currently trading for just over $28,700 and has a market capitalization of $556 billion, according to Cointelegraph data.

“How do we onboard the next billion users into crypto?” This is a question that gets thrown around at crypto conferences and metaverse meetups — one that people have been asking for some time. Reaching mass adoption may sound like a daunting task, but crypto media outlets like Cointelegraph help spread the news of what is going on in the cryptoverse every day, helping increase adoption.

Many people in the crypto space have likely had experiences where others ask them questions about various aspects of cryptocurrency, and trying to cohesively explain all the intricacies in one sitting can be a challenge. This tricky situation is what inspired the latest report from Cointelegraph Research.

Download the report on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.

The “ABCs of Crypto” report is a perfect start for those new to blockchain, giving a high-level overview of the major cryptocurrencies and blockchains, decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Throughout the report are links and references to all the useful resources found on Cointelegraph’s website. By combining these with other on-chain and statistical data from various sources, “ABCs of Crypto” is meant to be a starting place for those new to the space to learn about everything from why they should care about DeFi to the difference between hot and cold wallets and how NFT marketplaces work.

The world has just begun to adopt blockchain technology

Believe it or not, it took around five decades for electricity to be adopted by nearly 100% of households in the United States. It took the radio around four decades, color televisions took about three, and the internet took almost two decades. The adoption curve of modern technology seems to be getting shorter and shorter. The blockchain industry can be said to have started seeing adoption in the last five to six years. If Metcalfe’s law of exponential network effects spurred on by more users and usage holds true, blockchain may experience an even shorter adoption curve than other technologies of the past century.

DeFi and NFTs are good starting points

Finance and art are two aspects of the human experience that fit perfectly with blockchain, decentralized ledgers and all things crypto. The “ABCs of Crypto” report first focuses on understanding Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,600

, then moves on to other major platforms like Ethereum before discussing decentralized exchanges. It continues on to give readers an introduction to the world of DeFi. Starting with a timeline of NFTs, the report also explores how nonfungible tokens can be used outside of digital art in the form of JPGs — including music, tickets, land and identity.

Cointelegraph Research’s latest report is a starting place to help bring new people into the world of crypto. What better way to become part of the change and put Metcalfe’s law into full effect than by helping at least one or two people hop on board and get comfortable with all that the future of money has to offer?

Blur NFT lending surpasses $16M in loans, led by Machi Big Brother

The milestone comes just one day after the protocol's launch on May 1.

According to data sourced from user @beetle from Dune Dashboard, nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur has facilitated 8,820 Ether, or roughly $16.37 million, in loans through perpetual NFT lending protocol Blend one day after its launch. On May 1, Blur introduced Blend as a novel protocol for pledging NFTs for loans, which was developed in conjunction with venture capital firm Paradigm.

Together, the Azuki, Wrapped CryptoPunks and Milady NFT collections represent the largest collateral, with over 8,000 Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 worth in market value pledged. The top Blur lender, who has issued 58 loans worth 1,180 ETH, is Taiwanese celebrity Jeff Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother.

A prominent figure in Taiwan's music industry, Machi Big Brother is also an avid collector of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT series. Machi was one of the biggest recipients of the Blur token airdrop in February and reportedly sold 1,010 NFTs within 48 hours on Feb. 25 in the ""largest NFT dump ever.""

There are 846 active loans on the platform at the time of publication, with eight refinancing events. As a perpetual lending protocol, Blend automatically extends the duration of loans at expiry, assuming neither the borrowing nor lending party objects. Loans can also be refinanced or held at Dutch auction in case of interest rate changes. Protocol developers claim that Blend charges neither borrowing nor lending fees, but only interest.

Last year, NFT lending protocols fell into disarray after a crypto bear market caused many collectibles to become illiquid, some of which had no bids at all. One protocol, BendDAO, had as little as $23,715 to pay back lenders at the time after facilitating more than 15,000 ETH in loans.

The majority of people will have their wealth progressively eaten away by the devaluation of money, according to Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX.

According to Hayes, due to the huge amount of public debt accumulated by the world’s largest economies, governments will have no choice other than ""inflating it away"" through money printing. 

Thus, the only way to escape the progressive destruction of fiat wealth is by acquiring assets outside the traditional financial system, such as crypto, the purchasing power of which doesn’t fall compared to the cost of energy. 

“My whole goal with all of my investing is to preserve capital so that I can consume the same amount of energy or whatever energy amount that I would like from now and into the future,” Hayes said in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. 

However, the amount of crypto assets available is relatively small compared to the total amount of debt in the economy, which means that only a few will be able to preserve their capital as the majority see their wealth destroyed.

According to Hayes, the crypto crackdown in the United States reflects the government’s attempt to keep the masses within the traditional system by preventing them from fleeing to crypto.

“They want your capital to sit there and they'll make it a very pleasant, pleasant journey to lose 20, 30, 40, 50, 60% of your purchasing power over a period of time such that the debt load is effectively lowered and the finances are healthier,” he said.

Coinbase officers, board members face suit over alleged insider trading during listing

The suit charges the alleged inside traders saved over $1 billion by selling their shares when the company went public despite knowing they would lose value.

A Coinbase shareholder has filed a stockholder derivative complaint against some of the company’s executives and board members, claiming they profited from inside information during the company’s public listing. CEO Brian Armstrong and well-known venture capitalists are among the defendants.

A stockholder derivative complaint is a suit filed against a company on behalf of its stockholders. Coinbase shareholder Adam Grabski filed the suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 1. Grabski bought Coinbase shares on the first day of the crypto exchange’s public listing.

According to a redacted version of the complaint posted by the court, the defendants were able to sell $2.9 billion worth of Coinbase shares made available to the public through a direct listing of the company’s stock on the Nasdaq exchange on April 14, 2021, and in the week that followed.

If the company had made an initial public offering instead of directly listing on the exchange, the defendants would have been prevented from selling their shares, and the value of the shareholdings would have been diluted.

The suit alleges that the defendants were able to sell their shares before disclosing information they already had that negatively affected the share price, which fell by more than 37% by May 18, after “the compression of the Company’s revenue margins during the first fiscal quarter and the issuance of a dilutive convertible offering were publicly disclosed.” According to the suit:

“Defendants were privy to material, non-public information about the health of the Company ahead of their multi-billion-dollar liquidity event. […] Delaware law does not permit, however […] fiduciaries trading on the basis of, and profiting from, such material, non-public information.”

The company lost over $37 billion in market value after the unfavorable disclosures. However, “Defendants, comprising a majority of the Board, sold $2.93 billion of stock” before the price fell, preventing a loss of over $1 billion to themselves. 

The suit charges breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and demands payment of damages to the company with interest, return of ill-gotten gains to the company and reimbursement of the plaintiff for expenses.

Related: Coinbase could face SEC enforcement action for ‘potential violations of securities law’

The suit names nine individuals, including Armstrong, former chief product officer Surojit Chatterjee, chief operating officer Emilie Choi, chief financial officer Alesia Hass, chief accounting officer Jennifer Jones and board members Marc Andreessen, Frederick Ehrsam, Fred Wilson and Kathryn Haun.

A Coinbase spokesperson commented on the case in an email to Cointelegraph: “As the most popular and only publicly traded crypto exchange in the US, we are at times the target of frivolous litigation. This is an example of one of those meritless claims.”

This suit was filed on the same day as a class-action suit over alleged violations of Illinois privacy laws in its Know Your Customer procedure. On the brighter side, the company launched the Bermuda-based Coinbase International Exchange on May 2.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

Untangling public wallet keys

Sending and receiving transactions over the blockchain has many advantages. Some of these include the verifiability of transactions and the immutability of the blockchain. Thanks to the blockchain, digital value can be transacted in perpetuity, like a person handing over a physical dollar bill to someone else.

However, using the technology is not so simple for everyone. Users need a certain amount of knowledge about how blockchain and their wallets work, and they also need to know how to securely send crypto to a wallet.

One of the difficulties users might experience is that public keys can be quite intimidating. They are long strings of seemingly random numbers and letters. One mistake and the crypto is either lost or ends up in the wrong wallet. And with the immutability of the blockchain, there is no way to get it back.

Where there is a need, developers get to work. One of the popular projects that aim to make crypto transactions more user-friendly is Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This platform turns these complicated wallet addresses on Ethereum into easily readable domain names, just like any website.

For a long time, however, it was impossible to integrate a comparable solution for the Bitcoin network.

A step toward ‘smart’ Bitcoin

This all changes with BTCDomain. The platform uses ordinals and zk-STARKs, short for “zero-knowledge Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,” to generate unique domain addresses that can be used on the Bitcoin network. But how does it work under the hood?

In essence, ordinals are unique inscriptions in transactions on the Bitcoin network. In this way, ordinals are verifiable using a blockchain explorer. BTCDomain uses this approach to associate Bitcoin domain addresses. The platform contains all the necessary metadata within a Bitcoin transaction. When a user sends BTC to one of the registered domains, for example, “satoshi.btc,” the platform resolves the underlying public key so that the BTC ends up at the correct address.

To ensure that this happens correctly, users should be able to trust that the system is resolving the transaction correctly. This is where the zk-STARK technology comes in.

One of the options is for users to run a full Bitcoin node in combination with an ordinal database on their own machine. While this is possible, it requires some technical skills and time. BTCDomain solves this problem by resolving a transaction using the resources of the platform. It inspects each Bitcoin transaction and generates a zero-knowledge proof. Users can then confirm that the domain address holds the underlying public key they are sending BTC to.

What’s more, with the latest Miami update, BTCDomain now allows users to inscribe their own website on the Bitcoin network. Thanks to the update the platform can automatically resolve domain names to the dedicated web2 website. For example, if a user owns ordinal.btc and builds an html file and inscribes it on the Bitcoin network, BTCdomain can automatically show this website on ordinal.btc.page.

Criticism against ordinals

However, the use of ordinals on Bitcoin has drawn criticism. Due to its growing popularity, the network’s activity increased significantly. In turn, this led to higher transaction fees, leading critics to oppose the use of the Bitcoin network for anything other than financial transactions. Founder of BTCDomain Jay Lee is a firm believer that it is everyone’s own choice what they do with Bitcoin: “Everyone could always use Bitcoin as a financial transaction chain. We (who believe in ‘smart’ Bitcoin) don’t affect any original use of Bitcoin. Someone might argue ordinals have pushed transaction fees higher. But we are in a free market. Whoever pays the highest gas fee rate gets included in a block. It is fair.”

According to Lee, BTCDomain brings “smart Bitcoin” closer by showing developers that it is possible to build trustless applications that rely only on Bitcoin. This could lead to a thriving decentralized finance sector built on the Bitcoin blockchain in the future.

Social media is the digital world’s go-to source for entertainment, communication and self-expression. Despite developing new ways to monetize content, this monopolized market still lacks a transparent and engaging reward system for user-generated content. On top of that, there is no trustworthy voting mechanism for crowdsourcing decisions.

For example, TikTok, a popular application that lets users create video shorts, implemented monetization features like Creator Fund and virtual gifts. However, the platform’s reward system still lacks transparency and fairness. Creators often express concern over the uneven distribution of revenue and the opaqueness of the algorithms that determine content reach and visibility.

Using the built-in paid advertising tag seems to lead to lower content views. Some successful TikTok influencers even observed their views drop after joining the fund, suspecting that the application was intentionally limiting their visibility to cap their payout. One of the influencers told Wired: “I ended up leaving the Creator Fund. I’d much rather my followers see my videos than make a few cents on views. I’m disappointed with the way it hurt people more than helped.”

Besides the lack of transparency, another issue plaguing most social media platforms is the lack of a reliable and trustworthy voting mechanism for crowdsourcing decisions. While users can gather opinions through comments, likes or informal polls, these methods are susceptible to manipulation and lack the security and verifiability required for transparent decision-making.

Privacy is king

To address the chronic lack of transparency and trustworthiness, Dutch social media platform SocialBlox is leveraging blockchain technology, with its main features revolving around decentralization, transparency and security. The all-in-one platform lets users unleash their creativity by sharing photos and videos to engage with communities.

The social media ecosystem is fueled by SBLX, SocialBlox’s native token that users can earn as a reward for using its platform and convert on secondary markets like decentralized exchanges.

To begin with, SocialBlox addresses the paramount issue of privacy by not sharing user data with third parties or using it to optimize the content algorithm. Social media giants, including Facebook and TikTok, have been accused of privacy-related wrongdoings, such as personal data leaks and misuse. SocialBlox has no revenue model for selling data. It doesn’t disclose nor sell user data to third parties.

Another feature highlighting the user-oriented approach is privacy-mode access. By default, the SocialBlox app does not show ads. Users can allow companies to show ads and collect SBLX tokens as a reward.

This app paves the way for post-to-earn platforms

Earning rewards from displaying ads is a good incentive, but the platform’s most interesting implementation is its post-to-earn initiative for users who complete challenges on the platform. With this feature, users can earn SBLX tokens by accepting challenges set by other individuals or groups. For example, users can track challenges and receive updates with a single click. They can engage followers in decisions like holiday destinations, car colors or meal choices, with the majority determining the outcome. Thanks to the transparent voting system backed by the verifiable nature of the Polygon blockchain, the application eliminates concerns of fake voting rounds. This transparent voting system also presents a significant opportunity for companies to attract participants in their voting rounds.

DOWNLOAD SOCIALBLOX FOR APPLE OR ANDROID

In the future, companies could challenge users to share a video of their newly purchased products in exchange for SBLX, or influencers could complete personalized challenges sent by their fans. And the SocialBlox app will allow creators to live a more decentralized life by providing the tools and platform to connect and share content with millions of people.

The Ethereum network underwent the successful Shapella hard fork on April 12, allowing validators to withdraw their long-staked Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 from the Beacon Chain after three years. In the first week of withdrawals, more than a million ETH was unstaked by validators.

However, from the second week onward, the number of ETH staked was higher than that of ETH withdrawn, indicating that validators are re-staking most of their ETH back into mining pools.

Staking is temporarily locking tokens on a network that uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In a PoS network like Ethereum, users who wish to support the blockchain by validating new transactions and adding new blocks must “stake” a certain amount of cryptocurrency. In return, they receive rewards.

Staking ensures that a blockchain is only updated with valid data and transactions. Participants wanting to increase their chances of validating new transactions offer to stake large amounts of cryptocurrency as insurance.

Ether being re-staked is a big positive for the Ethereum network, but its future in the United States remains uncertain. Ethereum staking is getting tricky for many U.S.-based validators as staking service providers, particularly centralized exchanges, are fighting a regulatory battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

In February, Kraken crypto exchange settled with the SEC for $30 million and closed its staking services for U.S clients. The SEC claimed that the service qualified as a security and that Kraken must obtain the necessary license to operate.

Kraken withdrew its validator nodes for U.S. clients just a day before the Shapella upgrade to comply with SEC orders. The shutdown triggered an industry-wide debate on the future of staking services in the United States. Coinbase — one of the first crypto exchanges to go public in the U.S. — also provides staking services and is trying to force the SEC to answer a petition it filed regarding guidance for cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong claimed that the SEC’s efforts to curtail staking service providers would prohibit retail staking in the United States. This might force many crypto platforms and staking service providers to move to offshore locations. At a time when the SEC is proactive in its enforcement action against crypto-staking services, the future of ETH staking looks shaky in the United States.

Magazine: Whatever happened to EOS? Community shoots for unlikely comeback

Stephenie Lord Eisert, senior director of law enforcement at crypto intelligence firm Merkel Science, told Cointelegraph that cryptocurrencies are a global entity. Thus, a clampdown by one particular jurisdiction would only force service providers to move elsewhere.

“The proposed ban on crypto staking will not protect investors from fraud or scams. Instead, it will create a regulatory void that will be exploited by bad actors. Rather than banning centralized staking providers, regulators should focus on addressing the lack of guidance around both centralized and decentralized staking options,” she said.

Staking-as-a-service under threat in the U.S.

The U.S. is home to the majority of node operators on the Ethereum blockchain. Of the 9,849 active nodes, 5,214 are in the U.S., followed by 1,679 in Germany and 277 in Japan. The latest data from Etherscan indicates that node operators in the U.S. declined by 20% in the past week.

William Kraus, a partner at FisherBroyles law firm, told Cointelegraph that the SEC’s enforcement against Kraken shows the commission’s position on staking-as-a-service.

He added that this could prompt U.S. providers to respond in several ways, with some eliminating the service altogether, while others might implement changes to how they provide the service or publicly describe it. Some providers might decide not to change anything. However, the settlement has lessened ambiguity about staking, and providers must carefully consider the SEC’s position going forward, he said, adding:

“The U.S. certainly has not banned staking-as-a-service. Instead, the Kraken settlement establishes that the SEC considers at least some forms of staking to fall under its jurisdiction. The market response remains to be seen, but we can reasonably expect fewer, and perhaps more limited, offerings of staking-as-a-service to retail consumers in the U.S.”

Danny Talwar, head of tax at Koinly, told Cointelegraph that centralized staking providers account for almost a quarter of all staked ETH, with Coinbase (11.4%), Kraken (6.9%), and Binance (5.2%) leading the way.

Talwar said that if the SEC moves on with its enforcement action, staking service providers will be forced to look outside the U.S. to offer their services.

“If offshore exchanges with no Know Your Customer or Anti-Money Laundering compliance end up being major beneficiaries of the SEC cracking down on regulated, domestic, centralized exchanges, ‘consumer protection’ may be the least likely outcome,” he said.

The rise of decentralized staking

While U.S. regulators are clamping down on staking services, crypto proponents are trying to convince regulators that high-yield lending interests offered by centralized entities and staking rewards on the Ethereum blockchain are not the same.

Staking crypto on a blockchain like Ethereum contributes to daily transaction verification. Thus, Ethereum staking differs from lending rewards like those offered by BlockFi and Celsius.

On the other hand, the SEC is looking to brand all kinds of staking services under a standard banner, Konstantin Boyko-Romanovsky, CEO of staking service provider Allnodes, told Cointelegraph.

Boyko-Romanovsky said prohibiting centralized exchanges from offering staking services would further enhance decentralization. He also noted that the government’s approach might stifle adoption as many newcomers to crypto in the U.S. rely on centralized entities such as Coinbase for staking services.

He noted that staking pools might become more popular among retail stakers, explaining:

“Staking pools will probably experience an increase in participation from the United States, as the concept of staking pools democratizes access to staking opportunities and associated rewards. However, it is difficult to predict the exact extent of this potential influx, as it will depend on various factors such as mainstream acceptance and adoption, regulatory policies, scalability and ongoing innovation.”

He added that those interested in staking will likely find alternative means. “The focus of the regulatory bodies should be on creating precise and clear definitions for new and innovative concepts, such as staking. It would likely benefit customers more than attempting to force crypto instruments into existing fiat currency molds,” he said.

The troubles of centralized staking services might work in favor of decentralized staking services and staking pools. After Kraken’s withdrawal of U.S-based validator nodes, most of these validators moved to Lido Finance, a decentralized staking pool service provider.

While it may help decentralization, the SEC’s stance on crypto staking could mean trouble for U.S.-based service providers. However, it remains to be seen whether firms like Coinbase uproot and move abroad, abandon significant market share in the domestic market, or make efforts to comply with SEC guidance and U.S. securities laws.

Coinbase International Exchange launches amid SEC crypto crackdown in the US

The Coinbase International Exchange will roll out trading by listing Bitcoin and Ether perpetual futures.

As the cryptocurrency industry faces regulatory challenges in the United States, public crypto exchange Coinbase is moving forward with a global derivatives platform.

On May 2, Coinbase announced the launch of the Coinbase International Exchange (CIE), a new institutional platform designed for crypto derivatives trading.

The CIE will start trading by listing Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,600

 and Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 perpetual futures later this week. All trading on the CIE will be settled in Coinbase-backed stablecoin USD Coin 

USDC

$1.00

, requiring no fiat on-ramps.

Coinbase stressed that direct access trading on CIE is available to institutional clients via application programming interface in eligible, non-U.S. jurisdictions. “These products are not available to retail customers at this time,” Coinbase added.

Coinbase didn't respond to Cointelegraph's request to comment on the exact jurisdictions where CIE will be available.

Another major crypto exchange, Gemini, also launched a non-U.S. derivatives platform on May 1. The exchange is open to customers in about 30 jurisdictions worldwide, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Bermuda, El Salvador, Philippines, Thailand and others. ""Gemini Foundation is not available to customers in the United States of America, United Kingdom, or the European Union,"" the firm stated in the announcement.

According to the announcement, the new international crypto platform is launched with support of regulators in Bermuda. As previously reported, Coinbase obtained a license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) by mid-April 2023. The Class F License allowed Coinbase to operate a digital asset exchange and a digital asset derivatives exchange provider as well as operate activities like token sales and issuance.

Coinbase noted that Bermuda’s regulatory environment is known for a “high level of transparency, compliance and cooperation.”

Bermuda is a self-governing British overseas territory with a parliamentary government. Similarly to the United Kingdom — where cryptocurrencies are currently legal — Bermuda has been friendly to crypto, growing increasingly bullish on the crypto industry recently.

In late April, Miami International Holdings, the operator of the Bermuda Stock Exchange, purchased remnants of the collapsed FTX crypto exchange. The company bought FTX’s futures and options exchange, and clearinghouse LedgerX for $50 million.

Previously, Bermudan Premier and Finance Minister Edward Burt declared that the government remains open to crypto despite industry failures like FTX. Last year, local authorities also stated that Bermuda would keep its crypto hub ambitions despite the industry facing a massive bear market in 2022.

The news comes amid major U.S. investment bank Citigroup downgrading Coinbase shares to neutral or high risk from buy or high risk with a $65 price target, down from $80. According to Citigroup analyst Peter Christiansen, regulatory unpredictability in the broader cryptocurrency sector is a looming threat to Coinbase.

Citi’s remarks came amid Coinbase shares already plummeting for several weeks. Over the past month, Coinbase shares plummeted more than 20%, dropping from a high of nearly $72 in April to $50 on Monday, May 1.

As previously reported, Coinbase planned to set up a global crypto exchange as of mid-March 2022. The first reports on Coinbase’s upcoming international crypto platform came just a few days before the exchange officially announced that it received a Wells notice from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In response, Coinbase filed a motion against the SEC on April 25, asking the regulator to clarify industry regulations.

International Business Machines Corp. is expecting to put a “pause” on hiring for ""back-office"" roles that could be potentially automated by artificial intelligence instead.

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna explained in a May 1 interview with Bloomberg that many “back-office” positions, such as those in the human resources and accounting departments, will likely be the first to be automated by AI.

The IBM boss added he could ""easily"" see 30% of these positions replaced by AI over a five-year period.

“I could easily see 30% of that getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period.”

IBM employs 282,000 employees globally, according to LinkedIn, and Bloomberg reports it has around 26,000 non-customer-facing staff — meaning around 7,800 jobs could be handed over to AI.

According to some reports, AI-based automation has already helped IBM save well over $1 billion in business expenses and maintenance costs.

Among the tasks that may be automated include providing employment verification letters or moving employees between departments.

However, Krishna thinks human resource roles that evaluate workforce composition, measure productivity and other tasks that benefit from human judgement likely won’t be replaced over the next decade.

Many industry pundits remain at crossroads on whether AI actually has the potential to leave humans without work on a mass scale.

A recent study found that 62% of Americans think implementing artificial intelligence in the workplace will have a “major impact” on workers within the next 20 years, leaving many employees “wary” and “worried” about what their future holds.

The more tech-savvy employees however feel slightly more secure about their future.

Blockchain developer Salman Arshad recently explained to Cointelegraph that instead of AI coming in to wipe out the developer market, it’ll only serve as a tool to increase efficiency.

“You know what your company wants to do. You can tell ChatGPT, and it can perfectly transform your commands into a smart contract, auditing process, document or white paper.”

“ChatGPT and AI tools are a blessing; they are not our enemies and are not here to end the career of a developer,” he added.

Another blockchain developer, Syed Ghazanfer, told Cointelegraph that the combination of human input and ChatGPT offers much more versatility than a complete transition to AI automation.

On the other hand, Dominik Schiener, the founder of the IOTA Foundation, believes that AI will take away employment opportunities from humans but at the same time, AI and robotic process will create new jobs:

“We’ll see more and more humans being forced to pivot to new roles that may look nothing like anything they’ve ever done.”

Aussie crypto exchange kicks off US expansion despite ‘regulatory risk’

“Where other exchanges see regulatory risk, we see opportunity,” says Coinjar CEO and co-founder Asher Tan.

Australian crypto exchange Coinjar is seeking to put its boots on the ground in the United States, with its CEO seemingly unfazed by the market's “regulatory risk.""

In an interview with The Australian on May 1, Coinjar CEO and co-founder Asher Tan said he saw opportunity despite a recent wave of U.S. crypto firms sounding alarm bells over the government’s approach to regulation.

“Where other exchanges see regulatory risk, we see opportunity,” he said, adding:

“We’ve always understood that regulation has a key role to play in crypto’s future and we believe the American market will reward an exchange with our unparalleled compliance bona fides.”

Coinjar is based in Melbourne and was founded in late 2013. It was one of the earliest exchanges to hit the market in Australia and also secured a license to operate in the United Kingdom in September 2021. It is reported to have around 500,000 customers across the two countries.

Coinjar kicked off its U.S. expansion plans in May by listing a single open role for an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance officer.

“CoinJar is expanding to the US, and we are seeking an AML Compliance Officer. The successful candidate will report to the Head of Legal & Compliance and the Board, take ownership of applicable programs and policies, including the AML/OFAC Program, and implement processes to ensure adherence to them,” the job listing reads.

Tan suggested that Coinjar’s focus on regulatory compliance will be key to thriving in a difficult environment like the United States.

“Licensing is done at a state level in the US, so we will be gradually adding states until we can get close to full coverage of states,” he said, adding that “while not every company is able or willing to satisfy this criteria, CoinJar believes we’re well suited to take on this challenge.”

Related: On the shutdown of Bittrex in the US and SEC actions — Bittrex Global CEO at Consensus 2023

While the idea sounds good in theory, U.S. exchanges such as Coinbase provide an example of the potential roadblocks that Coinjar could face.

Coinbase has claimed on several occasions that it has actively sought to engage in dialogues with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the name of compliance, but has ultimately had those efforts thrown back in its face.

The SEC slapped Coinbase with a Wells notice on March 22, essentially threatening legal action over some of the firm’s offerings, which it asserts are violating securities law. Coinbase however, has argued that it already disclosed such an offering to the SEC prior to getting the greenlight to go public.

In response, Coinbase has since filed a petition in federal court requesting the SEC to propose and adopt clearer regulatory guidelines for the cryptocurrency industry in the U.S.

“We are literally sitting up here on stage asking for regulation, asking for rules, asking for a framework that makes sense for our particular technology so that we can be registered,” Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said at Consensus 2023 on April 27.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

While many pre-existing NFT marketplaces already host peer-to-peer sales of digital artworks, the auction house is attempting to separate itself by offering a “rotating, curated selection of leading artists hand-picked by Sotheby’s specialists.”

All NFT sales on the Sotheby's Metaverse platform occur by way of smart contracts that allow digital art collectors to pay for their art and collectibles with the choice of Ether

$1,847

 or Polygon

$0.8733

.

Sotheby’s also noted it would honor artist royalties through smart contracts on the secondary sales platform and will automatically pay artists according to the royalty rate they choose to select.

According to a Sotheby’s May 1 announcement on Twitter, the platform will launch featuring works from 13 prominent digital artists, including the pseudonymous artist XCOPY, Claire Silver, Tyler Hobbs and Hackatao.

Just three months later on Sept. 10, Sotheby’s facilitated an action of 101 Bored Ape NFTs that cleared a total of $24 million.

In November 2021 Sotheby’s conducted the largest NFT charity auction in history, auctioning off 140 rare NFTs to raise funds for the nonprofit healthcare organization Sostento.

Saylor, who serves as MicroStrategy’s chairman, attributed the successful quarter to sharp execution in the firm’s core business model and its Bitcoin investment thesis, which he described as the “right strategy,"" adding:

“So ultimately, it’s not easy to see what better strategy there might be. And so, we are strong proponents of a Bitcoin strategy. And as you can see from this chart, simply acquiring and holding Bitcoin in a prudent fashion is a pretty good way to outperform the market.""

The Bitcoin advocate predicted that investors will soon exit their positions on crypto assets that are “under the microscope in the regulatory environment,” which in turn will “flow into Bitcoin.”

MicroStrategy chief financial officer Andrew Kang added the firm also managed to reduce its leverage by repaying its $161 million Bitcoin-backed loan from the now-collapsed Silverage Bank:

“By retiring the debt, we also released all of the Bitcoin that were pledged as collateral securing the loan. This was an important and strategic transaction for us and our liability management goals.""

According to previous SEC filings, the business intelligence firm bought 7,500 BTC in Q1 across two purchases on March 23 and April 5 for a total of $179 million.

The firm now holds 140,000 BTC, which were collectively purchased at an average cost of about $29,803.

The firm’s turn to profit comes as BTC managed to rise 72% over the first quarter to about $28,300.

With the price of BTC at $28,100 currently, MicroStrategy is down around 5.7% on its Bitcoin investment.

The firm was however in the “green” for a period of time last month when BTC skyrocketed to its most recent high of $30,980 on April 15.

Saylor recently revealed that MicroStrategy integrated Bitcoin Lightning into his corporate email address.

The Bitcoin-savvy firm is also in the process of developing a Bitcoin layer-2 Lightning Network-based Software as a Service tool for corporations.

The Michael Saylor-founded firm went back into the green in the first quarter of 2023 with a profit of $94 million, which was largely attributed to a one-time income tax benefit of $453.2 million.

In addition to the tax benefit, the firm cashed in $121.9 million in revenue, up 2.2% from the same time last year.

Phong Lee, the firm’s CEO, explained in the May 1 statement that MicroStrategy’s “conviction” in its Bitcoin

 investment strategy is as “strong” as ever:

“The conviction in our Bitcoin strategy remains strong as the digital asset environment continues to mature.”

""We remain disciplined on costs while investing in growth, and we will continue to execute our dual strategy of growing our business intelligence software business and acquiring Bitcoin for the future,"" he added.

Lee also stressed that its “core business"" is not impacted by short-term price fluctuations in BTC.

Decentralized exchange Level Finance has experienced a security breach allowing an attacker to steal more than $1 million of the exchange’s native Level Finance (LVL) token. 

Level Finance informed its 20,000 Twitter followers that more than 214,000 of the exchange’s LVL tokens had been drained and swapped into 3,345 Binance Coin 

BNB

$313

, with an approximate value of $1.01 million. 

An exploit targeted our Referral Controller Contract.

- 214k LVL tokens drained to exploiters address.
- Attacker swapped LVL to 3,345 BNB
- Exploit was isolated from other contracts.
- Fix to be deployed in 12 Hrs.
- LP's and DAO treasury UNAFFECTED.

More details to follow.

— LEVEL Finance #RealYield (@Level__Finance) May 1, 2023

According to blockchain security firm Peckshield, Level Finance’s “LevelReferralControllerV2” smart contract contained a bug that allowed for “repeated referral claims” from the same epoch. This was confirmed by Level Finance in a later statement made on Discord.

It seems the @Level__Finance's LevelReferralControllerV2 contract has a bug that allows for repeated referral claims from the same epoch. So far 214k LVLs have been drained and swapped into 3,345 BNB (~1M)

Meanwhile, according to data from Binance chain explorer BSC Scan, the v2 controller contract shows multiple calls of the “claim multiple” function over the past 48 hours.

At the time of writing, the implementation of the contract does not appear to have been altered since the advent of the attack; however, Level Finance said that it would deploy a new implementation of the referral contract within the next 12 hours.

The exchange also noted that its liquidity pools and related DAOs remain unaffected by the attack.

According to DeDotFiSecurity on Twitter, the team says that it has “temporarily shut down the referral program,” which has stopped the exploit.

On Discord, Level Finance said that the exploit had been isolated from other exploits and that users of the exchange should “stand by for a full post mortem.”

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Blend has neither oracle dependencies nor expiries, allowing borrowing positions to open indefinitely until terminated. Developers also claim that the protocol would collect zero fees from borrowers and lenders:

""Blend matches users who want to borrow against their nonfungible collateral with whatever lender is willing to offer the most competitive rate, using a sophisticated off-chain offer protocol.""

Per design, Blend automatically ""rolls a borrowing position for as long as some lender is willing to lend that amount against the collateral."" For this, no on-chain transactions are required unless one party decides to exit the position or there is a change in interest rate.

By using a perpetual lending protocol, borrowers and lenders extend the loan expiration time by a predetermined period by default. If a lender wishes to terminate the loan against the borrower's wishes, an interest-rate ""Dutch auction"" for refinancing is held when the borrower has not repaid the debt at expiration. The auction begins at 0% refinance interest with a steadily rising rate.

""In Blend, an NFT may be liquidated whenever a lender triggers a refinancing auction and nobody is willing to take over the debt at any interest rate.""

That said, developers explained that borrowers can repay the loan at any time on Blend. ""If a borrower wants to change the amount they have borrowed or get a better interest rate, they can atomically take out a new loan against the collateral and use the new principal to repay the old loan,"" they wrote.

Launched in the third quarter of 2022, Blur has rewarded users with ""care packages,"" redeemable for BLUR tokens since Feb. 14 to increase trading activity. The platform has since surpassed OpenSea in terms of trading volume.

On the shutdown of Bittrex in the US and SEC actions — Bittrex Global CEO at Consensus 2023

Oliver Linch suggested jurisdictions with established frameworks for crypto and policymakers willing and able to use them were a potential winning combination for fledgling firms.

INTERVIEW
Join us on social networks

Oliver Linch, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex Global, has pushed back against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), claiming the company never had a clear opportunity to discuss a potential enforcement action.

Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Consensus 2023 conference in Austin, Texas on April 28, Linch said there had been “precisely zero” communication between Bittrex Global and the SEC prior to the financial regulator issuing a Wells notice to the company’s U.S. counterpart in March. The SEC charged Bittrex in April for operating as an unregistered exchange, broker and clearing agency, and it charged Bittrex Global “in connection with its operation of a single shared order book along with Bittrex.”

The Bittrex Global CEO echoed many of the complaints U.S.-based crypto companies have lobbed at the SEC in regards to its position on enforcement actions, hinting the “come in and talk to us” approach often espoused by Chair Gary Gensler doesn’t hold water. Upon receiving a similar Wells notice from the SEC in March, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal said the firm had met with the financial regulator “more than 30 times over nine months” but largely did not receive any feedback.

“We never heard from them, they didn’t speak to us, they didn’t ask us for any information, they had no interaction with Bittrex Global whatsoever,” said Linch on the SEC. “It’s this uncertainty that permeates everything. You just don’t know what’s coming next or where it’s going to come from or why or how in the U.S.”

In March, Bittrex announced plans to wind down its U.S. operations by April 30, specifically citing the challenging regulatory and economic environment in the United States. At the time, the exchange said regulatory requirements for crypto firms in the U.S. were “often unclear and enforced without appropriate discussion or input.” It’s unclear if the firm reached this decision prior to its Well notice.

The EU’s forward-thinking #MiCA framework supports crypto innovation, while the US’s retrofitted regulation-by-enforcement struggles to provide clarity.

Will the US lose ground to Europe's clear guidelines, or can they adapt for the future of #crypto? Only time will tell.

— Oliver Linch (@OliverLinch) April 30, 2023

Though Bittrex had operations in the U.S., the global firm is regulated in Liechtenstein and Bermuda, which Linch claimed had some of the “most successful regulatory regimes in the world.” Coinbase reported in April it had received a license to operate in Bermuda as part of its plans for a derivatives exchange.

The Bittrex Global CEO suggested a “combination of regulations and regulators” as a potential winning recipe for crypto firms looking to start in the space — both the established framework for digital assets and policymakers willing and able to use it. Linch said he could see aspects of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets, or MiCA, framework modeled on regulations in Liechtenstein and Bermuda.

In the U.S., however, many firms continue to cite the lack of regulatory clarity in weighing whether to move operations outside the country. Lawmakers recently questioned SEC Chair Gensler on digital assets during committee hearings on oversight for the financial regulator.

Social media is the digital world’s go-to source for entertainment, communication and self-expression. Despite developing new ways to monetize content, this monopolized market still lacks a transparent and engaging reward system for user-generated content. On top of that, there is no trustworthy voting mechanism for crowdsourcing decisions.

For example, TikTok, a popular application that lets users create video shorts, implemented monetization features like Creator Fund and virtual gifts. However, the platform’s reward system still lacks transparency and fairness. Creators often express concern over the uneven distribution of revenue and the opaqueness of the algorithms that determine content reach and visibility.

Using the built-in paid advertising tag seems to lead to lower content views. Some successful TikTok influencers even observed their views drop after joining the fund, suspecting that the application was intentionally limiting their visibility to cap their payout. One of the influencers told Wired: “I ended up leaving the Creator Fund. I’d much rather my followers see my videos than make a few cents on views. I’m disappointed with the way it hurt people more than helped.”

Besides the lack of transparency, another issue plaguing most social media platforms is the lack of a reliable and trustworthy voting mechanism for crowdsourcing decisions. While users can gather opinions through comments, likes or informal polls, these methods are susceptible to manipulation and lack the security and verifiability required for transparent decision-making.

Privacy is king

To address the chronic lack of transparency and trustworthiness, Dutch social media platform SocialBlox is leveraging blockchain technology, with its main features revolving around decentralization, transparency and security. The all-in-one platform lets users unleash their creativity by sharing photos and videos to engage with communities.

The social media ecosystem is fueled by SBLX, SocialBlox’s native token that users can earn as a reward for using its platform and convert on secondary markets like decentralized exchanges.

To begin with, SocialBlox addresses the paramount issue of privacy by not sharing user data with third parties or using it to optimize the content algorithm. Social media giants, including Facebook and TikTok, have been accused of privacy-related wrongdoings, such as personal data leaks and misuse. SocialBlox has no revenue model for selling data. It doesn’t disclose nor sell user data to third parties.

Another feature highlighting the user-oriented approach is privacy-mode access. By default, the SocialBlox app does not show ads. Users can allow companies to show ads and collect SBLX tokens as a reward.

This app paves the way for post-to-earn platforms

Earning rewards from displaying ads is a good incentive, but the platform’s most interesting implementation is its post-to-earn initiative for users who complete challenges on the platform. With this feature, users can earn SBLX tokens by accepting challenges set by other individuals or groups. For example, users can track challenges and receive updates with a single click. They can engage followers in decisions like holiday destinations, car colors or meal choices, with the majority determining the outcome. Thanks to the transparent voting system backed by the verifiable nature of the Polygon blockchain, the application eliminates concerns of fake voting rounds. This transparent voting system also presents a significant opportunity for companies to attract participants in their voting rounds.

DOWNLOAD SOCIALBLOX FOR APPLE OR ANDROID

In the future, companies could challenge users to share a video of their newly purchased products in exchange for SBLX, or influencers could complete personalized challenges sent by their fans. And the SocialBlox app will allow creators to live a more decentralized life by providing the tools and platform to connect and share content with millions of people.

What are some ways to avoid IP infringements in the NFT space?

This article discusses the challenges of intellectual property rights in the world of NFTs, with insights from the Hermes vs. Rothschild lawsuit and other potential cases.

While nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have been gaining traction since the start of the year, the hype element is now fading away. More digital artists and creators worldwide are using NFTs to monetize their work with minimal investment, transforming the digital art space. Nevertheless, the blurred lines between artistic expression, plagiarism and trademark infringement have caused legal challenges, as regulations around cryptocurrencies and digital collectibles aren’t cast in stone yet.

For example, the Hermes vs. Rothschild lawsuit addressed critical questions about trademark infringement and NFTs. In this case, the popular French luxury design house Hermes sued 28-year-old creator Mason Rothschild over his MetaBirkins collection, which included 100 NFTs featuring digital, fur-covered bags resembling Hermes’ iconic Birkin range. On Feb. 8, 2023, a nine-member jury reached a verdict in Hermes’ favor. The court found Rothschild liable for trademark infringement, trademark dilution and “cybersquatting,” awarding the company $133,000 in damages.

This legal battle underscored the importance of digital artists and big brands drawing clear lines between their work and trademarks to prevent a negative impact on both parties — at least until regulations are clarified. For users, explicit rules are of great importance, as they can prevent them from investing in scams and forgeries.

NFT analytics firm detects another case of IP infringement

In a potentially similar instance of IP infringement, NFT analytics firm bitsCrunch discovered that the popular NFT collection Coodles appears to incorporate the McDonald’s logo within an attribute labeled “McCoodles.” This particular attribute showcases the McDonald’s logo on hoodies in the collection. Out of 8,884 NFTs in the series, 434 of them feature the McDonald’s logo as an attribute.

Source: OpenSea

At the time of writing, these 434 NFTs have generated over $500,000 in total volume, and 398 different owners have these McDonald’s-themed NFTs. The collection has garnered 3,373 Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 in overall volume, with a floor price of 0.0059 ETH since its inception.

According to OpenSea’s description of the project, Coodles is a “community rewarding collectibles project of 8,888 randomly generated NFTs on Ethereum.”

In the recent Hermes vs. Rothschild case, the court stated that artists, critics and commentators’ rights do not extend to the point where they cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the content. So far, there is no public information about any collaboration or agreement between McDonald’s and Coodles.

As per Kantar, McDonald’s is the sixth most valuable global brand and the fifth one in the United States. The brand’s value surged 27% in 2022 to almost $200 billion.

The case is relevant to McDonald’s, as the company has been actively expanding into the Metaverse, filing multiple trademark applications to establish virtual restaurants last year.

As established by the Hermes IP infringement case, featuring a brand’s logo in an unrelated NFT collection could potentially mislead consumers and damage the brand’s reputation. Moreover, NFT purchasers receive limited rights, increasing the risk of unintentional copyright infringement.

Anyone can detect IP infringement in NFTs

In the Hermes vs. Rothschild case, NFT marketplaces OpenSea, Rarible and Zora agreed to delist the MetaBirkins collection. This means that the owners of these NFTs have limited exposure to secondary markets to sell their assets. To avoid similar situations, investors should monitor NFTs and check for any IP infringement before making a purchase.

BitsCrunch has been developing APIs that assist brands in determining if their logos have been utilized in NFT collections, thus helping them safeguard their intellectual property rights. Thanks to its NFT Forgery Detection API, the blockchain analytics firm identified the connection between the Coodles collection and the McDonald’s logo.

Source: bitsCrunch

Besides brands, this API allows anyone to track whether an NFT collection incorporates a brand name and, as a result, could be liable for IP infringement.

The AI-driven API can detect partially or completely counterfeit NFTs, fabricated logos and brand identities of well-known brands, as well as new or existing NFTs, to protect users from investing in potential scams and forgeries.

Guardians of the NFT ecosystem

In the blockchain space, NFTs have had the most widespread adoption in comparison to cryptocurrencies, which have had more than 10 years to get to where they are today. Like all innovations, this adoption brings both good and bad, like when online sellers market famous brand names and products in the Metaverse as virtual goods or NFTs without permission. With this new virtual marketplace comes new questions for brands: How do real-world intellectual property rights apply to products in the Metaverse? How can brands protect their intellectual property?

Although bitsCrunch can’t fully respond to these questions and completely prevent all shady projects, the team can fight them and do its best to help brands remove these counterfeit NFTs from the NFT marketplaces and enforce their rights.

Going forward, bitsCrunch plans to strengthen cooperation with governments and financial institutions in the fight against crypto fraud and wash trading, and actively support a wide range of users — from novices to professionals — in the NFT and blockchain space, detecting and eliminating fraudulent activity across the NFT ecosystem.

Gary Gensler, the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, recently appeared before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee for a hearing regarding his leadership of the regulatory agency. 

The hearing, with Gensler as the only witness, promised to be unpleasant for the SEC chair, with the federal agency’s actions during Gensler’s leadership since spring 2021 coming under scrutiny.

From the introduction by the committee chair, Representative Patrick McHenry, Gensler was under fire for the SEC’s perceived overreach and approach of regulation through enforcement.

McHenry stressed that the absence of a clear position on the legal classification of cryptocurrencies doesn’t make it easier for companies to comply with the SEC’s demands.

A day before the hearing, Representative Warren Davidson announced a measure to fire the SEC boss and cut the power of his successors “to correct a long series of abuses” against the crypto industry.

As threatening as it may sound, this was not the first and will likely not be the last attack on Gensler. The SEC chair has made himself several enemies during his two years in the top job — and not just in the crypto industry.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

But hyperbole and congressional saber-rattling aside, was the April 18 hearing that bad for the SEC chair, and could it soften his position on crypto?

Grilling and cheering

The fiery opening statement by McHenry was inspired by the SEC’s impressive record of 50 separate enforcement actions against digital asset firms and the agency’s request for an additional $78 million of funds to expand its activity.

McHenry blamed Gensler for the “nonsensical” punishment of crypto companies, which failed to comply with the laws they didn’t know even applied to them, with “not sufficient, nor sustainable” regulation by enforcement and “overly aggressive” rulemaking.

Magazine: Whatever happened to EOS? Community shoots for unlikely comeback

In his prepared testimony, Gensler debunked the reprimands about rushed rulemaking, citing the standard procedures (the length of comment periods for the SEC propositions currently averages more than 70 days) and the necessity to meet the urgent challenges of the time, digitalization being chief among them.

Speaking of crypto, Gensler once again reinstated his position that “most crypto tokens are securities” and should be regulated by the SEC. In his opinion, the market is “rife with incompliance” and, in the name of investors’ protection, should be regulated in line with the standards applied to traditional finance:

“It’s the law; it’s not a choice. Calling yourself a DeFi [decentralized finance] platform, for instance, is not an excuse to defy the securities laws.”

Representative Tom Emmer asked whether Gensler was concerned that such an approach could result in crypto businesses fleeing the U.S. but did not give the SEC chief time to answer.

Representative Barry Loudermilk was a bit more constructive. He asked Gensler whether he believed a government agency’s centralized access to private investors’ information is more secure than the decentralized crypto market. In response, Gensler defended the necessity of the consolidated audit trail to “help surveil the market.”

All those who emphasized the word “grilling” were probably disappointed by the support Gensler received during the hearing. At the beginning of the meeting, he got words of appreciation from Representatives Maxine Waters and Bred Sherman, who welcomed the SEC’s fight against “crypto bro billionaires.” Representative Stephen Lynch humorously asked to specify whether the amount of written guidance by the commission is not the sort of clarity the crypto industry wants.

It was New York Democrat Representative Ritchie Torres who stated that instead of paying more attention to the likes of “offshore, underregulated, overleveraged” companies like FTX or Binance, the SEC targeted an onshore and regulated exchange like Coinbase.

Torres also mentioned the SEC’s interest in stablecoin issuers Paxos but not in Tether. Gensler responded that conducting a proper investigation in cases with overseas companies simply takes longer.

Representative Davidson, whose intent to fire Gensler by legislation was already made public before the hearing, cornered the SEC chair with a request to clarify whether he considers Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 and XRP 

XRP

$0.42

 securities. Though, it should be noted that Davidson didn’t give Gensler much time to provide a clear response, proceeding to read a long list of the SEC’s supposed failures.

Representative Mike Flood pressed Gensler to comment on the SEC issuing the staff accounting bulletin 121 (SAB 121) without consulting any banking regulators beforehand. Issued in March 2022, SAB 121 required crypto platforms to list digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets at fair value. Reluctant at first, Gensler admitted the agency did not consult banking regulators but noted that the SEC consulted instead with the Big Four accounting firms.

Last but not least was the participation of Representative Erin Houchin, who cited the European Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Act as an example of a comprehensive framework for the digital industry, which, in her opinion, the U.S. lacks. In response, Gensler assured her the country enjoys a clear regulatory framework built over 90 years.

Takeaways 

The hearing was not dedicated exclusively to the SEC’s crypto strategies. In fact, despite the topic’s strong presence in the opening speech, the regulator’s climate disclosure rule for publicly traded companies drew the most attention from lawmakers.

The crypto industry didn’t get much news from Gensler, who, on the one hand, was quite reluctant to go into details, and, on the other, faced more symbolic pressure rather than genuine attempts to interrogate.

“It is highly unlikely that any of the questions presented or arguments raised did much, if anything, to sway the SEC’s current regulatory approach to the crypto-asset industry,” Jackson Mueller, director of policy and government relations at Securrency, told Cointelegraph.

“The SEC and Gensler did not confirm whether ETH is a commodity or a security,” CoinRoutes chief technology officer and co-founder Ian Weisberger told Cointelegraph. However, what should be noted in his opinion is Gensler’s assurance that existing legislation is enough to regulate crypto:

“The SEC’s stance is that crypto companies should register under existing securities laws that were written in the 1930s. These laws are tailored toward centralized companies and have disclosure requirements that do not work for the unique structure of crypto networks.”

Another important takeaway was the partisan division on crypto. All but one representative who questioned Gensler on digital assets was a Republican. This is, perhaps, unsurprising, given Republican opposition to the Biden Administration appointee; however, it still illustrates how crypto legislation is not immune to partisan political divisions.

The contours of this division get even more striking if one looks at those who champion crypto advocacy, be it Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis at the federal level or State Senator Wendy Rogers of Arizona. The same goes for the critics, with Democrat Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown being the most notable.

Is there a chance that the SEC could soften its stance under the current chair? CoinRoute’s Weisberger believes the agency has good-faith regulators like Hester Peirce. Peirce, also known as “Crypto Mom,” has repeatedly raised concerns about the rules regarding trading platforms that do not handle tokens qualifying as securities or how to address operators that move from securities to non-securities trading. In Weisberger’s opinion, the best hope still lies with Congress passing some kind of legislative framework above the level of the SEC.

Tech giant Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, submitted a filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for new debt shelf offerings. 

The Big Tech company filed the prospectus on May 1, saying that it “may, from time to time, offer and sell debt securities in one or more series.” The statement continued to say each time a debt security is sold, it will issue a new “prospectus supplement” containing the “specific terms of the debt securities offered.”

Debt shelf offerings, or debt securities, are a provision that grants the issuer (i.e., Meta) the ability to register a new issue of securities without the need to sell the entire issue at once.

Additionally, the filing stated that debt securities may be offered and sold to or via “underwriters, brokers, dealers, or agents as designated from time to time, directly to one or more other purchasers, or through a combination of such methods.“

The filing did not disclose the exact amount of debt securities being offered.

Shelf offerings have the potential to be helpful to investors by occasionally giving insights into a company’s game plan for raising capital. On the other hand, new shares could also potentially negatively impact the price of current shares.

On Twitter, the community responded by trying to connect the dots to Meta’s recent spending on AI development and buybacks as a potential reason for the new alternative funding sources.

This filing also comes shortly after Meta released its latest earnings report, revealing a nearly $4 billion loss from its metaverse unit. This loss follows a deficit of $14 billion over the last year, with Zuckerberg anticipating more to come in 2023. 

Nevertheless, sources close to Meta recently shared that the company offers its metaverse developers salaries of anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million a year.

In August 2022, Meta raised $10 billion in its first-ever bond offering to fund share buybacks and business investments.

Tokens but not crypto: Nigeria SEC prepares new digital asset rules

Nigeria’s securities regulator will take at least 10 months to determine whether to register a digital asset-related company.

Nigeria, one of the world’s most curious nations about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,605

, is preparing new industry regulations for digital asset platforms.

The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering allowing licensed digital exchanges to list tokens backed by certain assets, Bloomberg reported on May 1.

According to the Nigerian SEC’s head of securities and investment Abdulkadir Abbas, the authority plans to only authorize listings of tokens based on assets like equity, debt or property. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,605

 and Ether 

ETH

$1,847

 will not be among those assets, Abbas reportedly said.

Nigeria’s SEC aims to register fintech firms as digital sub-brokers, crowdfunding intermediaries, fund managers and tokenized coins issuers. The authority will not register crypto exchanges until the central bank provides clear regulations for the crypto market.

Abbas noted that license applicants would undergo a year of “regulatory incubation,” allowing the SEC to study their operations and render their services in the country. He added:

“By the 10th month, we should be able to make a determination whether to register the firm, extend the incubation period or even ask the firm to stop operation.”

As previously reported, the Central Bank of Nigeria banned local banks from providing services to cryptocurrency-related platforms in early 2021. On the ban, the regulator cited high risks associated with trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The central bank also promised to impose strict penalties for any lender or financial institution failing to comply with the directive.

Despite the ban, Nigeria has emerged as one of the most active countries in terms of adoption and curiosity about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

According to data from Google Trends, Nigeria ranks second by search interest for the keyword “Bitcoin,” behind El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Other jurisdictions in the top-five crypto-curious countries list include Slovenia, Netherlands and Switzerland.

According to Chainalysis’ crypto adoption index, Nigeria was also among the top 20 countries in terms of crypto adoption in 2022.

While prohibiting cryptocurrencies, the Central Bank of Nigeria has been actively promoting its central bank digital currency known as the eNaira. Following a sluggish start, the eNaira reportedly saw increased adoption due to national fiat reserves facing severe shortages.

The blockchain and crypto industry is constantly growing and changing around the world, and the Principality of Liechtenstein is no exception. 

The sixth smallest country in the world, located in the middle of Europe between Switzerland and Austria, has attracted the attention of the international and European crypto communities alike since the early days of the industry. 

In 2019, Liechtenstein became one of the first countries in the world to adopt specific legislation on crypto and blockchain, namely the Token and Trusted Technology Service Providers Act (also known as TVTG or the Liechtenstein Blockchain Act), which has been in force since the beginning of 2020 and established one of the world’s first regulated environments for token-related services.

Since 2020, the number of crypto service providers in Liechtenstein has been increasing, as companies find optimal conditions there to establish and develop their crypto business. The TVTG’s high level of regulatory certainty and direct communication with the local financial market regulator, the Financial Market Authority (FMA), have also contributed to this crypto-friendly environment.

What else makes Liechtenstein special and attractive for crypto service providers? Will the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation be compatible with Liechtenstein’s Blockchain Act? Or is Liechtenstein’s government planning to tighten the law after the collapse of major crypto businesses like FTX, Celsius or Three Arrows Capital?

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

To get a betting understanding of crypto’s future in the country, Cointelegraph sat down with Thomas Dünser, director of Liechtenstein’s Office for Financial Market Innovation and Digitization. Dünser is a senior adviser to the prime minister of Liechtenstein, responsible for innovation and digitalization issues within the Ministry of Finance and was the project leader and co-author of the Blockchain Act.

The first comprehensive national token law

From 2016 to 2018, the blockchain and crypto industry faced a tremendous amount of uncertainty as governments around the world had only begun to develop regulatory concepts for digital assets. Amid this uncertainty, the announcement that the Liechtenstein government considered blockchain as a promising technology was already something of a sensation.

With the publication of the draft law, it also became clear how Liechtenstein would treat tokens. In particular, Liechtenstein was the first country in the world to regulate the token as a legal instrument with the Token Container Model (TCM) and to classify tokens differently based on how they function (utility token, security token or payment token).

According to Dünser, this clarification alone that not all tokens are to be considered financial instruments has triggered “enormous positive feedback” from the industry and created “greater legal certainty” in the application of financial market laws.

He explained that the definition of the token, the regulation of ownership and possession of the token, and the delegation and transfer rules have not only clarified basic legal issues but have also “laid the groundwork for the use of tokens by established financial institutions” like custody services, banks or exchanges. Moreover, Dünser emphasized the importance of the “semantics” of the Blockchain Law:

“It created a common language space, which was crucial for technical and regulatory discussions about crypto and blockchain between authorities and market participants.”
The ability to innovate is critical

The Blockchain Act was designed in 2016 and passed back in 2019. At that time, there were no decentralized finance applications or nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on a scale like now, which calls for faster legal development.

How is Liechtenstein dealing with this scale of innovation?

Neither the trend toward decentralization nor toward NFTs was unexpected, said Dünser. “With our national token law, we have created the basis for a broad range of tokenizations, even going beyond NFTs. We have deliberately tried to think far beyond the current use cases of blockchain in our legislation. So, I don’t expect that we will have to re-regulate here anytime soon.”

Liechtenstein regulators have also taken the trend of decentralization into account in the Blockchain Act. The TVTG is “open for innovation” and flexible, “principle- and role-based — as a counter-model to the otherwise usual rule- and business model-based regulation” and “technology-neutral.”

In the Blockchain Act, activities are subject to regulatory requirements if they pose risks to users, regardless of the business model in which they are provided. In doing so, service providers themselves have to consider how to mitigate the risks, whether with technology or human resources. Dünser said:

“Given the rapid pace of technology-driven innovation, the ability of the legal system to innovate is critical. Without it, we not only slow down innovation but also face considerable legal uncertainty. Neither of these can be in the interest of states.”

In Liechtenstein, regulators have, therefore, established an innovation framework with the aforementioned state innovation process and the Regulatory Laboratory at the FMA. In Dünser’s view, it has proven to be “very successful”; however, since the important financial market laws in the European Economic Area are defined at the European level, analogous structures would be necessary for the whole regional regulatory system.

Similarities between the TVTG and MiCA

MiCA is an important step toward a unified European regulatory system, and the TVTG served as a sort of model for MiCA. In particular, the MiCA draft adopts the Token Container Model of the TVTG, the licensing requirement for offering certain blockchain-related services, and also the information requirements for public offerings.

So, there shouldn’t be any major changes to the existing practice in Liechtenstein after MiCA enters into force, and both laws will be well-compatible, noted Dünser.

Crypto service providers newly regulated under MiCA will no longer need to be regulated under the Blockchain Act.

“Like Liechtenstein, the EU Commission sees the token economy — in addition to financial market applications — as a great opportunity for Europe.”

Liechtenstein’s experiences were, therefore, relevant for European lawmakers, and there were “lively discussions” between both sides that are reflected in many regulatory philosophical similarities between the TVTG and MiCA: the token container model, the role-based and, to some extent, principle-based regulation, and openness to innovation.

“However, we need to distinguish between the civil law and supervisory law parts,” Dünser noted, adding, “MiCA includes only the prudential components. Each member state has to clarify the civil law foundations itself. With the Blockchain Act, Liechtenstein already has a comprehensive and robust legal framework for all types of tokenization, from equity tokens, and other crypto assets to NFT and other tokenized rights.”

“We are prepared to act”

As to whether Liechtenstein will tighten rules for the crypto market after the FTX crash and other big collapses in 2022, Dünser said it would better avoid overregulation. Moreover, the Blockchain Act already regulates the custody of tokens and also prescribed legal separation in the event of bankruptcy.

Nevertheless, Dünser agreed that certain adjustments are necessary. “I see greater challenges in staking or borrowing and lending of customer tokens by crypto exchanges, which is not regulated in many jurisdictions.”

In the European Union, for example, regulation for credit institutions, which is set up for similar activities involving money, does not apply to crypto service providers. MiCA also does not cover this issue, at least not yet.

“In my view, this regulatory gap should be closed urgently. We are following and monitoring this development closely and are also prepared to act.”

The American banking giant JPMorgan Chase is set to acquire First Republic Bank’s (FRB) assets after early efforts to rescue it failed. JPMorgan and multiple other banks submitted a bid to acquire the assets of troubled FRB on April 29.

The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed FRB on May 1 and entered into an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the receiver. The FDIC then entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with JPMorgan to protect depositors. 

JPMorgan will assume all assets of First Republic Bank, including uninsured deposits. FRB currently has $229.1 billion in assets and $103.9 billion in deposits.

As part of the transfer, 84 locations of First Republic Bank in eight states will reopen as JPMorgan Chase. All depositors of FRB will become a part of JPMorgan and have access to their total deposits insured by FDIC. Customers can continue to avail of banking services at the current branch until they receive any change notification from JPMorgan.

Apart from the transfer of assets, a loss-sharing agreement was also agreed upon between the FDIC and JPMorgan for residential and commercial loans acquired by the FRB. The losses and any recoveries on the loans covered by the loss-share agreement will be split between the FDIC, in its capacity as receiver, and JPMorgan.

The trouble started brewing for FRB on April 26 when the news about a government receivership surfaced. The bank’s shares started tanking from the announcement, sinking 20% in hours. The days following the announcement were even more volatile for the bank before the regulators eventually closed the bank.

FRB joined Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to become the latest U.S. bank to collapse in 2023.

Block, the financial services and technology company owned by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, has announced it has completed the prototype design of its new five-nanometre (5nm) Bitcoin

 mining chip — which it claims is key to decentralizing the supply of Bitcoin mining rigs.

According to a blog post published on April 28, Block explained that developing Bitcoin mining ASIC rigs is both financially and technically challenging. The result of this has been “the excessive concentration of custom bitcoin mining silicon” in the hands of a select few companies. Block deems this centralization harmful to both miners and the Bitcoin network as a whole.

Notably, the San Francisco headquartered company wrote that it plans to make Bitcoin mining technology “open source” where possible by selling standalone ASICs and other hardware components to “optimize innovation and maximize the size of the Bitcoin mining hardware ecosystem.”

The post adds that the steps taken over the past few months will allow the firm to experiment with new designs and aid them in bringing more efficient and affordable Bitcoin mining chips to market. In order to fast-track this development push, Block added that it has purchased a large batch of ASIC chips from Intel.

On April 18, Intel announced that it would halt taking new orders for its Blockscale 1000 Series ASICs by Oct. 20 and end shipping in April 2024 as part of cost-cutting measures. Block says this large intake of ASICs from Intel will help accelerate the development of its proprietary 3nm chip, which it claims upon its release, would be the most advanced chip to date.

“We can now focus our design team exclusively on cutting edge three nanometer ASIC development.”

The scale of a nanometer (1nm) is approximately equivalent to the width of two silicon atoms. As parts of the chips become smaller, it allows for more transistors to fit into a silicon die of the same size. By reducing the overall size, the electric current travels less distance in the circuit to perform a calculation, which means that overall efficiency is improved and the amount of heat produced is decreased.

It’s worth noting that 5 nanometre ASIC chips have been around for some time, with the earliest 5nm ASIC being released in 2021 from Chinese mining firm Canaan. Currently, most Bitcoin mining ASICs run on 5nm chips; however, no company has made their ASIC chip designs open source.

ASIC stands for “application-specific integrated circuit” and refers to a computerized device that is optimized to complete a single computational function and is typically used for mining proof-of-work cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

Crypto exploits, exit scams and flash loan attacks saw little signs of letting up in April, with more than $103 million of funds stolen from crypto projects and investors in the month. 

On April 30, crypto security and auditing firm CertiK posted an April roundup of crypto exploits, scams and hacks, revealing total funds lost in April was $103.7 million, bringing the total year-to-date loss to $429.7 million.

The month was particularly marred with major crypto exploits, such as $25.4 million lost due to an exploit of several MEV trading bots on April 3, $22 million stolen in a hot wallet exploit at the Bitrue exchange and the hack of South Korean GDAC exchange leading to a loss of $13 million.

The total lost to crypto and DeFi exploits in the month amounted to $74.5 million, making up around half of the total $145 million exploited in the first four months of the year, according to CertiK.

The month also saw around $20 million lost to flash loan attacks, led mainly by Yearn Finance after a hacker exploited an old smart contract on April 13.

The blockchain security firm noted that total funds lost to exit scams reached $9.4 million in the month, with the top exit scam for the month being Merlin DEX, which lost $2.7 million. On April 26, CertiK reported that it was investigating a “potential private key management issue” at the exchange.

Furthermore, the exit scam occurred after the protocol was audited by CertiK, which warned about centralization issues. CertiK launched a compensation plan following the attack in which it urged the rogue developer to return 80% of the stolen funds with a 20% white hat bounty offered.

According to De.Fi’s Rekt Database, there were over 50 crypto exploits, scams, hacks and rug pulls in April. Moreover, a large portion of them was memecoin rug pulls.

The most recent was the Polygon-based Ovix protocol, which lost $2 million in a flash loan attack on April 28.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

, however, attributing probabilities of 35% and 45% respectively for the coins to go to near zero.

The Coinbase executive concluded that ChatGPT is “generally” a “big fan” of Bitcoin but remains “more skeptical” when it comes to altcoins.

Prior to the cryptocurrency predictions, Grogan asked ChatGPT to assign odds to several political predictions involving Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Joe Biden and former U.S. President Donald Trump.

Other predictions were aimed towards the impact of AI on humanity, religion and the existence of aliens.

“Aliens have visited Earth and are being covered up by the government,” reads one wild prediction — to which ChatGPT assigned a 10% probability.

The executive also shared a script of the prompt, which he then fed to ChatGPT to build the tables.

Grogan backed up the preciseness of the results by claiming to have tested out the prompt over 100 times:

“I ran this prompt 100 times on a wiped memory GPT 3.5 and 4 and GPT would return very consistent numbers; standard deviation was

It isn’t the first time the executive experimented with crypto-related issues using ChatGPT.

On March 15, Grogan showed that GPT-4 — the latest iteration of ChatGPT — could spot security vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts and provide an outline to exploit faulty contracts.

Studies carried out by OpenAI — the team behind ChatGPT — have shown GPT-4 to pass high school tests and law school exams with scores ranking in the 90th percentile.

Meanwhile, Italy recently lifted a ban on the AI tool after banning it for one month following a series of privacy concerns that were raised to Italian regulators.

Friends and FOMO pushed newbie investors to buy crypto in 2022 — Survey

A survey from the United States Financial Industry Regulatory Authority indicates that new crypto investors tended to be swayed by suggestions from friends, compared to equities or bond investors.

Influence from friends and the fear of missing out (FOMO) were some of the reasons investors bought crypto for the first time in 2022, according to a survey by a United States financial regulator.

Published by the United States Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Investor Education Foundation in late April, the survey found that a large portion (31%) of new cryptocurrency investors cited “friend suggestion” as the primary reason for their foray into crypto. 

This is compared to only 8% for first-time equities or bond investors, potentially indicating that there is “a social element to cryptocurrency investing not evident in equities or bond investing,” according to FINRA.

However, the ability to “start with small amounts” was the second-biggest reason for making a move into the crypto market at 24%, similar to equities and bond investors.

Meanwhile, around 10% of respondents indicated a fear of missing out (FOMO) on a “potentially lucrative investment opportunity” led to them buying crypto for the first time, according to the survey.

The survey also found that 48% of crypto investors said they sourced information about the digital asset market from friends, family or work colleagues — compared to 35% for stock investors — followed by social media at 25%.

The survey also found that newer crypto investors were slighter younger on average (37 years old) and less college-educated (28.5% completed a four-year degree) compared to stock investors, who on average are 43 years old and 46.3% of whom have college degrees.

Interestingly, the study found that digital asset owners didn’t know as much about cryptocurrencies as they initially thought.

Digital asset investors scored 26.6% on a five-item quiz that asked questions about how a cryptocurrency is issued; transferred into U.S. dollars; how it is taxed; and how transactions may be “susceptible"" to fraud.

The 465 participants surveyed between Sept. 9 and Sept. 29 were randomly selected from U.S. households. The margin of error was 6.75%. The 2022 survey was part of a follow-up survey from 2020.

2 reasons why Bitcoin Ordinals are ‘positive’ for BTC: Grayscale

 Ordinals — also known by some as Bitcoin NFTs — could renew developer enthusiasm for Bitcoin and boost mining fees, according to cryptocurrency investment firm Grayscale.

In an April 27 “Market Byte” blog post, the firm suggested that Ordinals provide two key benefits to the growth and development of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The first is a substantial increase in fees paid to miners, which has been seen since the launch of the protocol in January, according to Grayscale.

“The advent of ordinals has led to an increase in total fees paid to miners [...] which could potentially establish a sustainable baseline level of transaction fees to incentivize miners.”

Grayscale argued that this would ensure “continued network security throughout the lifetime of the Bitcoin network.”

As reported by Cointelegraph, in less than two months after its launch, more than $600,000 was paid to Bitcoin miners, solely as the result of fees generated by Ordinal inscriptions. As of the time of publication, that figure now exceeds the $6.5 million mark.

The investment firm also believes that Ordinals and the “velocity of NFT adoption” could also attract new Bitcoin users and spark more development on the Bitcoin network. 

“We believe the emergence of ordinals is likely to promote a development-oriented community and culture in support of the Bitcoin network.”

On April 30, Ordinals reached a new record, with the number of daily inscriptions topping 300,000.

Around the same time, the number of Bitcoin transactions neared peaks not seen in a number of years, according to blockchain data firm IntoTheBlock.

The meteoric rise of Ordinals has been a controversial topic in the wider Bitcoin community, with Bitcoin maximalists extensively criticizing them for straying from the original purpose of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic currency and clogging up valuable block space.

One such critic is Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who has declared Ordinals to be “useless” and saythat he is “more into Bitcoin as a currency.”

Around the same time, the number of Bitcoin transactions neared peaks not seen in a number of years, according to blockchain data firm IntoTheBlock.

The meteoric rise of Ordinals has been a controversial topic in the wider Bitcoin community, with Bitcoin maximalists extensively criticizing them for straying from the original purpose of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic currency and clogging up valuable block space.

One such critic is Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who has declared Ordinals to be “useless” and saythat he is “more into Bitcoin as a currency.”

Crypto lender Genesis and its key creditor group have agreed to a 30-day mediation process in an attempt to move forward with a final restructuring plan, though one company is expressing ""frustration"" over the pace of progress.

On April 30, Gemini tweeted that Genesis, its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), its Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC) and Gemini have agreed to a 30-day mediation process in court on April 28. 

Gemini said its aim is to “drive to a final resolution as soon as possible,"" and that it was “supportive” of mediation. Gemini, however, added it had “expressed our frustration” regarding “the pace of progress among the parties and the need for urgency.”

2/ Gemini is supportive of mediation and working with the parties to bring this to a conclusion. We have also expressed our frustration on the record on the pace of progress among the parties and the need for urgency. The next status conference with the Court will be on May 4th.

— Gemini (@Gemini) April 30, 2023

The mediation is to move forward on a proposed bankruptcy exit plan submitted in February that expected creditors to recover 80% of lost funds. The plan is backed by DCG but the UCC opposed the restructuring deal, wanting better terms.

Genesis is slated to next appear in bankruptcy court on May 4. Sean O’Neal, a lawyer for Genesis, said in court on April 30 that it hopes to have two mediation sessions before May 8, with the deal’s final terms made public after the mediation period.

A mediator will need to be selected by Genesis and the UCC. O’Neal said potential mediators have started to be contacted and the process will be outlined to the court once one is selected.

On April 25, DCG expressed its thoughts on the matter when Genesis filed its motion for mediation.

The crypto conglomerate said the settlement would “prolong the court process” due to the renewed demands and added it was “difficult to understand the rationale” of Genesis creditors as they had given “limited engagement” since the plan proposed in February.

Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a New York District Court in January, estimating its liabilities were between $1 billion and $10 billion with assets in the same range.

The crypto lender was one of several firms hit by liquidity issues in the wake of the collapse of FTX.

Join us on social networks

Cryptocurrency exchanges have been instrumental in the adoption of blockchain technology, but the industry has become too dependent on them. Today, the crypto industry is still geared toward exchanges and traders rather than blockchain projects and developers. There is too much friction for developers building projects on the app layer.

Getting listed on a major centralized exchange (CEX) is a six-figure expense, plus additional fees each month for a market maker to ensure liquidity. In 2018, a Business Insider investigation found that crypto exchanges charge between $50,000 and $1 million to list initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Even after those expenses, exchanges are the ones who profit from all the trading fees, which drains value from crypto projects and makes it hard to attract liquidity in a sustainable way.

Besides exorbitant listing fees, DApp builders lose control over the liquidity and value of their tokens by having to abide by the exchange’s policies and fees. In addition, listing on centralized exchanges can also lead to counterparty risk (not your keys, not your coins).

Regaining control over native tokens

One of the alternative approaches to attract liquidity is to turn to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), which have reduced counterparty risk and low fees due to the absence of intermediaries. This solution may give app builders more control over the liquidity of their tokens, reducing reliance on centralized exchanges and improving security. Moreover, using DEXs rather than CEXs allows blockchain applications to benefit from DEX features, including non-custodial trading, reduced security risks and lack of KYC obligations.

As beneficial as DEXs are, they do have some drawbacks. For example, they are limited by the transaction capacity of their networks. As volume increases, so do the fees for executing trades. This has become a major problem for DEXs, many of which are hosted on Ethereum and use an automated market maker (AMM) to manage their trading. In addition, DEXs aren't efficient enough to compete with CEXs (e.g., in terms of capital efficiency and liquidity levels). Lastly, DEXs prioritize generating revenue for their liquidity providers and token holders, not the projects who use them.

While using a DEX enables self-custody and permissionless settlement, they’re not efficient enough. DEXs still lack support for off-chain pricing models, where pricing is based on the total aggregate liquidity in the market (both on- and off-chain) as opposed to the liquidity that happens to be in a given AMM's smart contracts.

There is a friction point in the user experience as well. Visiting a third-party DEX forces users to leave the apps they love whenever they make a trade.

Shopify for DEXs

The solution might be to make DEXs as efficient as CEXs and give each project ownership of its own DEX. But how to do that? ​​The good news is there are specialized projects that provide such DEX-as-a-feature solutions, and one of them is Native. The project makes it easy for developers to deploy exchanges, integrated directly into their DApps, earning their own swap fees and accessing the liquidity across the network.

Native is a DEX infrastructure layer, or more simply, a toolkit for any other project to become its own DEX, cutting out the middlemen and reducing costs, much like Shopify allowed entrepreneurs to create their own e-commerce sites.

Native’s proprietary integrations with professional liquidity providers and market makers account for over 30% of daily crypto trading volume, giving teams a significant advantage over standalone DEXs. Best of all, it's completely free to use: projects set their own swap fees, which go to token issuers.

The technology behind Native matches CEX-level efficiency and is completely modular, meaning that teams can create any type of exchange they want, using any liquidity sources, pricing models and trading pairs they desire. Projects can work directly with professional liquidity providers and market makers in a permissionless way, on-chain, and get their own liquidity.

Liquidity is king

Liquidity can come from one of three sources: the project itself, the community, or external liquidity sources such as automated market makers (AMMs), aggregators, and professional liquidity providers. Native can leverage a wide range of liquidity resources thanks to its approach of using off-chain pricing and on-chain RFQs (requests for quotes), which lets any project use market makers and professional liquidity providers for on-chain liquidity.

By providing a decentralized infrastructure layer for DEXs, Native is taking a big step toward solving the liquidity and control issues facing blockchain projects. With its innovative approach and focus on empowering crypto entrepreneurs, Native is helping blockchain projects benefit from increased revenue and deeper liquidity. Meanwhile, DApp users can swap the native token directly in the app, enjoying a simpler and more frictionless experience.

Ricky Li from Nomad Capital, which lead the $2M seed round investment in Native’s seed round, said:

“Native empowers everyone to have their own DEX and control of liquidity and fees. The vision is that no builders or users should be held hostage by CEXs and centralized DEXs like Uni or Curve to facilitate liquidity. This really resonates with our belief that there is a missing financial infrastructure layer that enables us to scale and attract the next users. We need more DeFi middleware infrastructure projects like Native.”

To demonstrate how easy it is to use the technology, Native released 5minuteDEX, a fully-functional DEX with deep liquidity across all the top trading pairs.

Source: 5minuteDEX.com

Native launched its private beta in March of this year and opened up the platform to anyone in April in a permissionless manner.

By providing a DEX layer, Native enables teams to create their own DEXs, reduce costs and regain control over their native tokens. Thanks to this approach, Native has managed to secure strategic partnerships with many blockchain projects, including Ankr, NodeReal, Metaverse.ai, Augmentlabs.io, CyberConnect, QuestN, LightNet and Byte.City.

Crypto platform Simple.app pilots new solution for sending money to Ukraine

The ongoing war in Ukraine has made financial services inaccessible for many, exacerbating the need for a low-cost, efficient solution.

International money transfers have long been a challenge for anyone who needs to send money from one country to another. Traditional banking systems are slow and expensive because many banks don’t have a direct relationship with each other, so they have to charge high processing fees or use an intermediary to complete a transfer. The multi-step process can take days or even weeks to complete a transfer. This makes it increasingly difficult for people to pay for expenses abroad or send money to loved ones who may be in a time crunch.

The situation has since been exacerbated by the ongoing war in Ukraine. As the war intensifies, an estimated 8 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, leaving them without access to basic necessities, including financial services. In many cases, traditional banking systems are nonexistent or disrupted, making it impossible for people to access their funds or receive money from loved ones in unaffected areas.

According to the National Bank of Ukraine, remittances to Ukraine increased in the fourth quarter of 2022, rising to almost $3.2 billion from $3.06 billion in the previous quarter. This is just one country, however. According to the World Economic Forum, India is expected to top $100 billion in remittances in 2022, followed by Mexico with $60 billion, China with $51 billion, the Philippines with $38 billion and Egypt with $32 billion.

These numbers make it clear that Ukraine, and the rest of the global economy, is in need of a solution that offers an extremely low cost for money transfers, with a simpler and faster transaction process between countries.

Cryptocurrency for international transfers

Critics, including influential policymakers, argue that the availability of traditional banking global transfer solutions and credit cards suggests that cryptocurrencies are irrelevant. This stance, however, overlooks the significant differences in the financial systems of different regions and the limited accessibility of such services in some places.

The emergence of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has disrupted the traditional method of transferring money, introducing faster, safer and more cost-effective transactions compared to traditional methods that rely on a complex web of intermediaries and high transaction fees. Although international money transfers are not a new use case in the blockchain space, they traditionally require a certain level of knowledge and understanding of cryptography. Therefore, in order to make this solution more accessible, a simplified solution that anyone could use was deemed necessary.

A solution to send money in a simple and easy way

Taking advantage of distributed ledger technology and the crypto world, the team behind Simple.App is proposing a solution that allows people in Ukraine to exchange cryptocurrencies for euros and later convert them to Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH) before withdrawing the money with a Ukrainian bank card. For example, a user buys USDT on the Polygon network using EUR, as stablecoins are not subject to volatility. Then the user transfers the USDT to P2P partners in Ukraine. This allows for instant interaction and avoids the bureaucratic elements associated with traditional bank transfers. As soon as the partner receives the USDT, they immediately convert it into UAH and complete the payment to the customer’s bank card. This simple scheme ensures a physical transfer for each payment and eliminates the need for loans or bank transfers. Because all these steps would take place on the backend, the user receives their funds almost instantly, with just a few clicks and without incurring any major fees.

Simple.App not only overcomes the challenges of high fees and complex banking relationships but also provides an efficient way for people to send money to their loved ones, offering competitive exchange rates and low fees. With “such a practical way and clear approach, we wanted to simplify their lives, giving them the possibility to help their relatives,” shared Alex Skalaban, the founder and CEO of Simple.App.

The app is available for both iOS and Android, and users can easily send money by linking their bank account or credit card. Considering all the circumstances, the team at Simple.App identified Ukraine as a priority country, but the team plans to offer transfers globally as well.

On March 31, OpenAI’s ChatGPT was temporarily banned in Italy after the watchdog suspected the AI chatbot violated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

Precisely 29 days after the ban, on April 29, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT was “available in Italy again” without revealing the steps taken by the company to comply with the Italian regulator’s transparency demands.

The revocation of the ban required ChatGPT to reveal its data processing practices and implement age-gating measures, among other legal requirements. As highlighted by the Italian regulator, the temporary ban came in response to a recent data breach suffered by ChatGPT on March 20.

While the abrupt ban initially raised possibilities about a wave of AI regulations, the willingness of ChatGPT to swiftly comply with local authorities is seen as an overall positive move, widely welcomed by its users globally.

European Union legislators are working on a new bill to monitor AI developments.

As Cointelegraph reported, the bill aims to classify AI tools according to the perceived risk levels based on their capability. The risk levels range from minimal to unacceptable. According to the bill, high-risk tools will not be banned entirely but will be subjected to stricter transparency requirements.

If signed into law, generative AI tools, including ChatGPT and Midjourney, will be subject to disclosure of the use of copyrighted materials in AI training.

Global financial services giant Mastercard has launched a new Web3 solution aimed at enhancing user verification standards and “reducing the opportunities for bad actors” in the digital asset space.

The solution announced on April 29 is dubbed the “Mastercard Crypto Credential.”

In an accompanying explainer video shared to Twitter, the firm outlined that its “building a way for Web3 and blockchain service providers to help secure transactions between users, verified according to standards set by Mastercard.”

At #Consensus23, we announced how we are instilling trust in the blockchain ecosystem through Mastercard Crypto Credential. With crypto wallet providers @Bit2Me_Global, @LiriumAG , @MercadoBitcoin and @UpholdInc and public blockchain network organizations @AptosLabs,… pic.twitter.com/P33mtDVAas

— Mastercard News (@MastercardNews) April 28, 2023

As part of the solution, users will be issued a “Mastercard crypto credential unique identifier,” which, in theory, enables people to instantly verify that an address they want to send funds to has been vetted by Mastercard and has been operating in compliance with the firm’s standards.

“The solution is also designed to support compliance through the exchange of essential metadata, required to meet regulations,” Mastercard stated, adding that it should help “reduce the opportunities for bad actors and the risk of funds being lost for good.”

As such, even if bad actors slip through the cracks and obtain a unique identifier, Mastercard can move quickly to revoke their verification if they have been found to have engaged in nefarious activity.

The firm named a long list of partners behind the solution. On the wallet side, Mastercard has teamed up with crypto wallet providers Bit2Me, Lirium, Mercado Bitcoin and Uphold.

In terms of blockchains, the firm has partnered with Aptos, Avalanche, Polygon and Solana.

Mastercard also outlined that it will be “tapping into CipherTrace’s suite of services — including CipherTrace Traveler — to help verify addresses and support Travel Rule compliance for cross-border transactions.”

Mastercard has been continually upping its exposure to the crypto sector over the past couple of years. The latest announcement comes just a few weeks after it launched a nonfungible token (NFT) gated musician accelerator program in collaboration with Polygon.

The program offers free access (until the end of April) to materials, unique artificial intelligence (AI) tools and other experiences to holders of Mastercard’s Music Pass NFT.

Mastercard competitor Visa also made a crypto move earlier this week after Cuy Sheffield, the firm’s head of crypto, took to Twitter on April 24 to announce a new stablecoin payments-focused project.

While details are sparse at this stage, Sheffield shared a job listing for the role, which notes that the company is “building the next generation of products to facilitate commerce in everyone’s digital and mobile lives.” The company is on the lookout for someone with strong experience in Web3 and blockchain tech.

Users of mobile payments service Venmo will soon be able to buy cryptocurrencies and send them to other Venmo users or external wallets beginning in May, according to an April 28 announcement from PayPal executive Jose Fernandez da Ponte. PayPal is the parent company of Venmo.

At a Consensus 2023 interview titled “PayPal’s Next Chapter in Crypto,” da Ponte explained how the new feature will work:

“Starting in May, we are going to be enabling on-chain transfers from Venmo wallets, meaning that you can buy crypto on Venmo and send it to another Venmo user; you can send it to a PayPal user; you can send it to [an] external wallet; you can send it to your hardware wallet.”

The executive said this feature would expand the choices available to Venmo users, which he said has proven successful when implemented on PayPal. It would also provide a “use case” for digital assets because now crypto will be used for “fast and free near-instant transfers between Venmo wallets and PayPal wallets, which is basically connecting two of the largest networks and wallets in the country.”

An April 28 help page from Venmo’s website states that verified users will also be able to receive crypto from external addresses through a “crypto address QR code.”

Venmo started allowing crypto purchases in April 2021, and the app’s mobile version currently lists Bitcoin 

BTC

ETH

$1,847

, Litecoin 

LTC

$79.03

 and Bitcoin Cash

 as options. Crypto features do not appear to be available on the desktop version.

PayPal has partnered with other companies to expand its crypto service offerings. In December, the payment provider integrated with MetaMask, allowing MetaMask users to purchase crypto through their PayPal personal accounts and have it sent directly to their self-custodial wallets.

Tax law researchers propose IRS framework for deducting crypto losses

A recently published study appears to advocate for the isolation of crypto assets from other tax deductions where losses are concerned.

Researchers at Indiana University and the University of Maine recently published a study examining the current state of cryptocurrency tax law in the United States. The research concludes with recommendations for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that, if adopted, would prevent taxpayers from weighing crypto losses against other capital gains.

The paper, dubbed simply “Crypto Losses,” seeks to define the various forms of loss that can be accrued by businesses and individuals invested in cryptocurrency and proposes a “new tax framework.”

Current IRS guidelines concerning cryptocurrency are somewhat nebulous. For the most part, as the researchers point out, cryptocurrency losses tend to follow the same taxation rules as other capital assets. They’re typically deductible against capital gains (but not other gains such as income), but there are some distinctions as to when and in what amounts deductions may occur.

Related: New tax rules could mean a US exodus for crypto companies

Cryptocurrency losses that accrue from specific cases defined as “sale” or “exchange,” for example, would be subject to deduction limitations. However, in other situations, such as having crypto stolen or instances where holders abandon their assets (through burning or other destructive means), taxpayers could deduct the losses in their entirety.

This is based on the information provided in IRS publication 551, as cited in topic 409:

“Almost everything you own and use for personal or investment purposes is a capital asset. Examples include a home, personal-use items like household furnishings, and stocks or bonds held as investments.”

According to the researchers, cryptocurrency losses should be regulated differently than other capital assets. The initial claim made in their research is that “the government is essentially sharing in the risk created by the investors’ activities” by offering a deductible against capital gains.

Their argument concludes that a new tax framework should be built wherein cryptocurrency losses may only be deducted from cryptocurrency gains.

The classification of a cryptocurrency as an asset, currency or property in various jurisdictions is of utmost importance for individuals to comply with tax laws and regulations. Dive deeper into the newest @CointelegraphCS report to know more https://t.co/tyDb1DQr2Z

— Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) April 21, 2023

According to the researchers, “losses from one type of activity should not be used to offset or shelter income from another activity.” Essentially, this suggests that cryptocurrency should be disenfranchised from other capital gains deductions.

However, the researchers acknowledge that other capital losses are not given similar treatment, stating that, currently, a “loss from the sale or exchange of any capital asset can offset gain from the sale or exchange of any other capital asset.""

As to why cryptocurrency losses shouldn’t be given the same taxation consideration, the authors state that by sharing risks with cryptocurrency investors in offering loss deductions on capital gains, the government may be stifling the economy and harming the cryptocurrency market:

“This risk-sharing can encourage investment in cryptocurrency and away from other investment activities of valuable economic significance. Risk sharing can also encourage investors to suddenly exit the crypto industry, which can harm legitimate exchanges and remaining investors.""

Despite the apparently subjective conclusion, the authors acknowledge that preventing taxpayers from applying cryptocurrency losses to other capital gains could harm investors who, under the status quo, would otherwise be entitled to the same taxation relief and recovery as those suffering similar asset losses unrelated to cryptocurrency.

What is Auto-GPT?

Auto-GPT is a unique open-source AI tool that harnesses the power of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models to generate human-like text and perform various tasks autonomously.

Auto-GPT is an open-source autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) tool that interacts with software and services online by utilizing OpenAI’s most recent text-generating models, namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model is a state-of-the-art language processing model that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text based on given input.

AutoGPT can perform a variety of jobs by creating human-like text answers in the absence of specific instructions. The system uses unsupervised learning to grasp the underlying patterns in the language to generate coherent text. For instance, Chef-GPT, an Auto-GPT program, can search the internet and produce one-of-a-kind recipes that are suitable for events or holidays. Moreover, Auto-GPT is a highly adaptable program with extensive use cases, including content creation and intricate coding projects.

The capacity of Auto-GPT to self-generate prompts to perform tasks, as well as its ability to connect with apps, software and services both online and locally, distinguishes it from other AI solutions. This means that, given a goal, Auto-GPT can devise a plausible advertising approach and create a rudimentary website. 

Its capacity to collect and validate external data is likewise exceptional. Auto-GPT is a prime example of how AI can simplify complicated operations and boost productivity in a variety of sectors, thanks to constant developments in AI technology.

How does Auto-GPT work?

Auto-GPT is an unsupervised learning AI tool that uses OpenAI’s GPT-4 and ChatGPT application programming interface (API) models, with pricing based on token usage, making it suitable for tasks such as content generation and coding projects.

Auto-GPT can learn and improve without explicit instruction as it uses unsupervised machine-learning techniques. To train the model, massive amounts of text data are fed into the system, which it then uses to learn how to generate natural-sounding text. The model takes a seed text as input, such as a question or a statement, and then generates a response based on the patterns and structures it has learned from the training data. 

Auto-GPT can be used by creating a paid account at OpenAI and obtaining an OpenAI API that connects Auto-GPT to a user’s OpenAI access account and bills them for usage. The API allows Auto-GPT to communicate with OpenAI’s GPT-4 and ChatGPT. OpenAI API offers a spectrum of models with different levels of complexity and capabilities suitable for different tasks. The models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search (searching for the meaning of words and phrases) and classification.

Pricing for Auto-GPT is based on a charge per unit of measurement called a token. One token is approximately four characters or 0.75 words. The usage cost is calculated based on the number of tokens sent through the API as a prompt and the number of tokens contained in the output. OpenAI account holders can set hard and soft limits on how much OpenAI will charge, and pricing starts at $0.002 for 100 tokens.
